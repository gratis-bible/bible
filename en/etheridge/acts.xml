      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>THE former writing, O Theophilus, I wrote concerning all those (things) which our Lord Jeshu Meshiha began to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until that day in which he was taken up, after that he had instructed those apostles whom he had chosen by the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom also he showed himself alive, after he had suffered, with many signs, for forty days, appearing to them, and discoursing on the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And when he had eaten bread with them, he directed them that from Urishlem they should not remove; but await the promise of the Father, which, you have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For Juhanon baptized with waters, but you shall be baptized with the Spirit of Holiness after days not many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>But they when assembled asked him, and said to him, Our Lord, at this time wilt thou restore the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He saith to them, This is not yours to know the time or the times which the Father hath reposed in his own authority:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>but when the Spirit of Holiness hath come upon you, you shall receive power to be made unto me the witnesses, in Urishlem and in all Jehud, and also among the Shomroyee, and unto the confines of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And as these he said, while they beheld him, he was taken up, and the cloud received him, and he was covered from their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they looked to the heavens as he went, two men were found standing with them in white vestments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>and they said to them, Men, Galiloyee, why stand you looking to the heavens 3? this Jeshu who is taken up from you into the heavens will so come as you have seen him ascend into the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>And afterward they returned to Urishlem from the mount which is called the place of Olives, which is over against Urishlem, and distant from her as seven stadias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And after they had entered, they ascended to that upper room in which were Petros, and Juhanon, and Jakub, and Andros, and Philipos, and Thoma, and Mathai, and Bar Tolmai, and Jakub bar Halphai, and Shemun the Zealous, and Jihuda bar Jakub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These altogether persevered in prayer with one soul, with the women, and with Mariam the mother of Jeshu, and with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>AND in those days arose Shemun Kipha in the midst of the disciples;-now there was there an assembly of men as an hundred and twenty;-and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men, brethren, it was right for that scripture to be fulfilled which the Spirit of Holiness had before spoken, by the mouth of David, concerning Jihuda, who was the leader of them who took Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he had numbered with us, and had part in this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>This is he who obtained the field with the wages of sin, and fell upon his face on the ground, and was severed in his middle, and all his bowels were shed forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And this hath been known of all who dwell in Urishlem; and so is called that field in the language of the country Hakel-damo, the interpretation of which is, A field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his habitation be desert, And no inhabitant be therein, And his ministry let another take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>There needeth therefore one from these men who have been with us in all this time in which our Lord Jeshu hath come in and gone out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>which went forth from the baptism of Juhanon until the day that he was taken up from (being) with us, to be with us a witness of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they set up two: Jauseph, who is called Barshaba, who is surnamed Justus, and Mathia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And praying, they said, Thou, Lord, (who) knowest the hearts of all, show the one whom thou choosest of these two,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>that he may receive the part in the ministry and the apostleship from which Jihuda separated, to go unto his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they cast the lots, and it came up unto Mathia; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>AND when the days of pentecost were fulfilled, while they were assembled all together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>there was suddenly from heaven the voice as of a mighty wind, and all that house in which they were sitting was filled with it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>and tongues that were divided like fire appeared to them, and sat upon each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in several tongues as the Spirit gave them to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>But there were men dwelling in Urishlem who feared Aloha; Jihudoyee, from all the peoples who are under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>And when that voice was made, the whole people assembled and were perturbed, because every man of them heard as they spoke in their (several) tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>(And) they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another, These all who speak, behold, are they not Galiloyee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How hear we (then) each in his own tongue in which we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthoyee and Medoyee and Alanoyee, and they who dwell in the Place of Rivers, Jihudoyee and Kapadukoyee, and of the region of Pontos and of Asia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>and from the land of Phrygia and of Pamphylia and of Metsreen, and the regions of Lybi neighbouring upon Kyrine, and those who come from Rumi, Jihudoyee, and Proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>and from Krete and Arabia, behold, we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonders of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>But all of them were amazed and admired, saying one to another, Of whom is this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others mocked them, saying, These have drunk new wine, and are inebriate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>And afterwards arose Shemun Kipha with the eleven apostles, and lifted up his voice and said to them: Men, Jihudoyee, and all who dwell at Urishlem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For not as you suppose are these drunken; for, behold, until now are three hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that spoken of by Joel the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>It shall be in the last days, saith Aloha, I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your youths shall see visions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>And your elders shall dream dreams: And upon the servants and upon the handmaids Will I pour my Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will give signs in heaven, And mighty (deeds) on earth; Blood and fire and clouds of smoke:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before shall come the day of the Lord, great and fearful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And every one who shall call the name Of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>MEN, sons of Israel, hear these words; Jeshu Natsroya, the man who from Aloha appeared with you, with powers and mighty acts, which Aloha wrought among you by his hand, (even) as you know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>This, who was separated thereunto by the foreknowledge and by the will of Aloha, you delivered into the hands of the wicked, and crucified and slew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>But Aloha raised him, and loosed the bands of Shiul, because it was not possible that he should be holden in Shiul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David said concerning him, I have foreseen my Lord at all time, Who is at my right hand that I should not be moved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Wherefore my heart is glad, And my glory rejoiceth: And also my body shall sojourn in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>For thou wilt not leave my soul in Shiul, Nor give thy Saint to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou wilt reveal to me the way of life, Thou wilt fill me with joy with thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men, brethren, suffer me to speak openly with you concerning the chief-father David, that he is dead and also buried, and his sepulchre is with us till this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>For he was a prophet, and knew that the oath Aloha had sworn to him, Of the fruit of thy loins I will cause to sit upon thy throne:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>And he foresaw and spake concerning, the resurrection of the Meshiha, that He would not be left in Shiul, nor would his body see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jeshu hath Aloha raised, and we all are his witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>And he it is who at the right hand of Aloha is exalted, and hath received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and hath shed forth this gift, which, behold, you see and you hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David hath not ascended into heaven, because he himself hath said, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Until I place thine adversaries the stool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Assuredly, then, let all the house of Israel know, that Lord and Meshiha hath Aloha made this Jeshu, whom you crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>AND when they heard, they were pierced in their heart, and said to Shemun and to the rest of the apostles, What shall we do, brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Shemun saith to them, Repent, and be baptized, every man of you, in the name of the Lord Jeshu, for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all them who are afar off, whom Aloha himself shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he testified to them and entreated of them, saying, Save (yourselves) from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>And some of them eagerly received his word and believed and were baptized, and there were added in that day as three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they were faithful in the doctrine of the apostles, and participated in prayer and in the breaking of the eucharist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And solemnity was on every soul; and many signs and mighty acts were done by the hand of the apostles in Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all those who believed were together, and every thing they had was in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And they who had property sold it, and divided to each according to that which he needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And every day they continued in the temple with one soul, and in the house they brake the bread, and took their food rejoicing and in the cleanness of their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising Aloha, (and) given (to be) in favour before all the people. And our Lord added daily them who were saved into the church.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>AND it was that as Shemun Kipha and Juhanon ascended together to the temple at the time of prayer, which is the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>behold a certain man lame from the womb of his mother, (whom) they carried, who were used to bring and set at the gate of the temple which is called the Beautiful, to beg alms of those who entered into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>He, when he saw Shemun and Juhanon entering the temple, prayed of them to give him alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Shemun and Juhanon beheld him, and said to him, Regard us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>But he regarded them, expecting to receive from them somewhat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Shemun saith to him, Gold and silver I have not, but what I have I give thee: In the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha Natsroya, rise and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And he took him by his right hand and raised him: and instantly his feet strengthened and his heels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And he leaped and arose and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and glorifying Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and glorifying Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they knew that it was he, the beggar, who had sat daily and asked alms at the gate which is called the Beautiful. And they were filled with wonder and astonishment at what had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>AND as he held Shemun and Juhanon, all the people ran wondering unto them to the portico which is called Of Shelemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And when Shemun saw, he answered and said to them, Men, sons of Israel, why wonder you at this? or why gaze you at us, as by power of ours, or by our (own) authority, we had done this, that this (man) should walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, and of Ishok, and of Jakub, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his son Jeshu, him whom you delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilatos, when he had justified (him) and would have released him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>but you the Holy and the Just denied, and demanded for you the man the murderer to be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>And Him the Prince of life you killed, whom Aloha hath raised from among the dead; and we all are his witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And by faith in his name, this, whom you see and know, he hath strengthened and healed; and faith which is in him hath given to him this soundness before you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>Now, however, my brethren, I know that through delusion you did this, as also did your princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>and Aloha, according to that which he had before proclaimed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Meshiha should suffer, hath fulfilled this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, and that the times of repose may come to you from before the presence of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and he may send to you Him whom he hath ordained for you, Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom the heavens must receive until the completion of the times of all those which Aloha hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets, who (have been) from of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Musha hath said, A prophet shall the Lord raise up unto you from your brethren, like to me; him hear in all (things) which he shall speak with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that prophet, perish shall that soul from his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And the prophets, all of them from Shamuel and they who were after him, spake and proclaimed concerning these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the sons of the prophets; and the covenant which Aloha set with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, In thy seed shall be blessed all the generations of the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>with you from the first he hath established; and Aloha hath sent his Son, blessing you, if you will return and repent of your iniquities.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>AND while they spake these words to the people, the priests, and Zadukoyee, and the governors of the temple, arose against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being angered against them because they taught the people, and preached through the Meshiha the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid upon them hands, and kept them unto the day after, because the evening had drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>And many who heard the word believed; and they were in number as five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And the day after, the rulers, and elders, and sophree, assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and also Hanan chief of the priests, and Kaiapha, and Juhanon, and Alexandros, and they who were of the race of the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And when they had made them stand in the midst, they questioned them, By what power, or in what name, have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Shemun Kipha was filled with the Spirit of Holiness, and said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of the house of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>hear: If we this day are judged of you concerning the good which has been done to the infirm man, insomuch that he is cured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be this known to you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jeshu Meshiha Natsroya, whom you crucified, whom Aloha hath raised from among the dead, through this Himself, behold, this (man) standeth before you well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone which you builders rejected, and he is become the head of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And in no other one is redemption: for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind, by which we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>And when they heard the words of Shemun and of Juhanon, which they had confidently spoken, they perceived that they knew not literature and were common-men, and wondered at them; and they recognised them, that with Jeshu they had been conversant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And they saw that the lame man who had been healed was standing with them, and they could not say any thing against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>Then they commanded that they should lead them from their assembly, and said one to another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>What shall we do with these men? For, behold, a conspicuous sign which hath been done by their hands to all the inhabitants of Urishlem is known, and we cannot deny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But that this report may not go forth more, we will threaten them that again they shall not speak in This Name to any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And they called them, and commanded them that not at all they should speak and teach in the name of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>SHEMUN KIPHA and Juhanon answered and said to them, If it be right before Aloha that you we obey rather than Aloha, judge you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For what we have seen and heard we cannot but speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>And they threatened them, and dismissed them; for they could not find cause to lay upon their head, because of the people; for every one glorified Aloha for that which had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For a son of more than forty years was that man in whom had been wrought this sign of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And when they were dismissed they came to their brethren, and made known to them whatever the priests and elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And they, when they had heard, with one accord lifted up their voice unto Aloha, and said, Lord, thou art God who hast made heaven and earth and the seas, and all that is in them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>And thou art he who hast spoken by the Spirit of Holiness in the mouth of David thy servant: Why rage the Heathen, And the peoples imagine vanity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings and powers of the earth arise And counsel together against the Lord, And against his Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For verily they are assembled in this city against thy holy Son Jeshu, whom thou hast anointed,-Herodes and Pilatos with the Gentiles and the synagogue of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to work whatsoever thy hand and thy will have signified before should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now also, Lord, behold and see their threatenings, and give unto thy servants with boldness to preach thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>while thy hand thou outstretchest unto healings and mighty works which they shall do in the name of thy holy Son Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And as they prayed and supplicated, the place in which they were assembled was moved, and they were all filled with the Spirit of Holiness, and they spake with openness the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>BUT to the assembly of the men who believed there was one soul and one mind; and no man of them said of the goods which he possessed that they were his own, but all whatever they had was in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power did those apostles testify concerning the resurrection of Jeshu Meshiha, and great grace was with all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>And no man of them had want; for they who possessed fields and houses sold, and brought the prices of whatever was sold</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and laid at the feet of the apostles, and there was given to each according to that which was needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>But Jauseph, who was entitled Bar Naba by the apostles, which is interpreted, A son of consolation, a Levoya from the Isle of Kypros,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>AND a certain man whose name was Hanania, with his wife whose name was Shaphira, sold a field,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>And Shemun said to him, Hanania, how hath Satana thus filled thine heart that thou shouldest lie to the Spirit of Holiness, and conceal from the silver of the price of the field?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>Was it not thine own until it should be sold? and when it was sold thou hadst yet power over the price of it. Why hast thou laid up in thy heart to do this thing? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto Aloha!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>And when Hanania heard these words he fell and died. And there was great fear upon all those who heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>And they who were young men among them arose and composed him, carried him forth and buried him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And there was great fear upon all the church and in all them who heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>AND by the hand of the apostles were done great signs and mighty works among the people: and all gathered together at the portico of Shelemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>And from the others not a man dared to come near them; but the people magnified them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>And the more were they who believed added to the Lord, an assemblage of men and of women;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so that into the streets they brought forth the diseased lying on beds, that, when Shemun should come, even his shadow might overshadow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>But there came many to them from the other cities round about Urishlem, bringing the diseased and those who had unclean spirits: and they were healed, all of them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And they went forth in the time of morning, and entered the temple, and taught. But the chief of the priests and they who were with him arose (and) convoked their associates and the elders of Israel, and sent to the house of the bound to bring the apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>and said, We found the house of the bound shut carefully, and the keepers standing at the gates: and we opened, but no man found we there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>And when the chief priests and rulers of the temple heard these words, they were astounded by them, and reasoned, what this was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>And one came and declared to them, Those men whom you shut up in the house of the bound, behold, they are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then went the rulers with the satellites to bring them, not with violence, for they feared lest the people should stone them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>Did we not commanding command you, that you should teach no man in this name? But, behold, you have filled Urishlem with your doctrine, and you will to bring upon us the blood of this man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>SHEMUN answered with the apostles and said to them, Aloha must we obey rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers hath raised up Jeshu whom you killed and hanged on the tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>Him hath Aloha constituted a Prince and a Saviour, and elevated him at his right hand, to give repentance and remission of sins unto Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we are witnesses of these words, and the Spirit of Holiness himself, whom Aloha hath given to them who believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>And when they heard these words they were transported with rage, and were mindful to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>And one of the Pharishee arose, whose name was Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, and honoured by all the people, and commanded to take the apostles without a little time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>And he said to them, Men, sons of Israel, beware of yourselves, and consider what it behoves you to do concerning these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before this time arose Thuda, and said of himself that he was something great, and there went after him four hundred men: and he was slain, and they who went after him were scattered and became as nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>Afterward arose Jihuda Galiloya in the days when men were enregistered for the head-silver, and tempted much people after him; and he died, and all they who went after him were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I say to you, keep aloof from these men, and dismiss them; for if from men be this imagination and this work, it will be dissolved and end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>but if it be from Aloha, there is no power in your hands to bring it to an end: lest you should be found to have arisen against Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And they were persuaded by him, and called the apostles, and scourged them, and commanded them that they should not teach in the name of Jeshu, and loosed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>And they went out from before them, rejoicing to be worthy for the sake of the Name to be ill treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>And they ceased not daily to teach in the temple, and in the house, and to preach concerning our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>AND in those days the disciples being many, the Javnoyee disciples murmured against the Ebroyee because their widows were slighted in the daily ministration.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>And this saying was pleasing before all the people; and they chose Estephanos, a man who was full of faith and the Spirit of Holiness; and Philipos, and Prokoros, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmena, and Nikolos, a proselyte of Antiokia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>And these they set before the apostles: and while praying they laid upon them the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of Aloha increased, and the number of the disciples increased in Urishlem greatly: and much people of the Jihudoyee were obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>But Estephanos was filled with grace and power, and wrought signs and miracles among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>And men arose from the congregation which was called Libertinu, Kyrainoyee, and Aleksandroyee, and from Cilicia, and from Asia, and disputed with Estephanos,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>and were not able to stand against the wisdom and the spirit which spake in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they sent men and instructed them to say, We have heard him speak words of blasphemy against Musha and against Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>From oppression and from judgment was he led; And his age who shall recount? For his life is taken from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>That eunuch said Unto Philipos, I pray thee, of whom speaketh this the prophet? of himself, or of another man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philipos opened his mouth and began, from that very scripture, preaching to him concerning our Lord Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they went in the way they came to a certain place which had water in it, and that eunuch said, Behold the water; what is the hinderance that I should be baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he commanded that the chariot should stand; and they descended both of them to the water, and Philipos baptized that eunuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>And when they had ascended from the water, the Spirit of the Lord rapt away Philipos, and the eunuch again saw him not; but he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>But Philipos was found at Azotos, and from thence he itinerated and evangelized in all the cities until he came to Cesarea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>BUT Shaol was yet full of threatenings and murderous wrath against the disciples of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>And he demanded letters from the chief priests which he should give at Darmsuk to the synagogues, that if he found (any) who walked in this way, men or women, he might bind and bring them to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>And as he went and began to come nigh to Darmsuk, suddenly there shone forth upon him a light from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice which said to him, Shaol, Shaol, why persecutest thou me? It is hard to thee to kick against the pricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>He answered and said, Who art thou, my Lord? And our Lord said, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>but arise, go into Darmsuk, and there it will be spoken with thee concerning what thou must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>And the men who went with him in the way stood astonished, because the voice alone they heard, but a man was not seen by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>And Shaol arose from the earth, and could not see any thing when his eyes were opened. And they took him by his hand and brought him into Darmsuk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>and he saw not for three days, neither did he eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>But there was in Darmsuk a certain disciple whose name was Hanania. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Hanania. And he said, Behold me, my Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And our Lord said to him, Arise, go to the street which is called the Straight, and inquire in the house of Jihuda for Shaol, who is from Tarsos the city. For, behold, while praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>he hath seen in a vision a man whose name is Hanania, who entered and laid upon him the hand that his eyes might be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>And Hanania said, My Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, of how much evil he hath brought upon thy saints in Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>And behold, here also he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all those who invoke thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>And the Lord said to him, Arise, go; for a vessel is he to me, chosen to bear my name to the nations, and to kings, and to the house of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will show him what he is to suffer on account of my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Then Hanania went to the house unto him, and he laid upon him the hand, and said to him, Shaol, my brother, our Lord Jeshu hath sent me; He who appeared to thee in the way while thou wast coming, that thine eyes may be opened, and thou mayest be filled with the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And instantly there fell from his eyes something which was like to scales; and his eyes were opened, and, arising, he was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And he took food and was strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>and was (certain) days with those disciples who were in Darmsuk. And at once he preached in the synagogues of the Jihudoyee concerning Jeshu, that he is the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>And all they who heard him wondered, and they said, Is not this he who persecuted all those who call upon this name in Urishlem? And behold, also, hither upon the self-same (object) was he sent to bind and take them to the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>BUT Shaol was the more strengthened, and moved those Jihudoyee who dwelt at Darmsuk, while he showed that this is the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And when days were many to him there, the Jihudoyee wrought treachery against him to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But their treachery was showed to Shaol, which they sought to do to him; and that they kept the gates of the city day and night to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>Then the disciples set him in a pannier, and dismissed him from the wall by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And he went to Urishlem, and willed to be attached to the disciples. And all of them were afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Bar Naba took him and brought him to the apostles, and recounted to them how in the way he had seen the Lord, and what he had spoken with him; and how in Darmsuk with boldness he had spoken in the name of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>And he went in with them and went out in Urishlem. And he spake in the name of Jeshu with boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>and disputed with those Jihudoyee who knew Greek; but they were wishful to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>And when the brethren knew, they brought him by night to Cesarea, and from thence sent him to Tarsos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Nevertheless, in the church which was in Jihud, and in Galila, and Shomreen, there was peace, while (it) was edified; and going forward in the fear of Aloha, and in the consolation of the Spirit of Holiness, was multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>And it was that while Shemun itinerated among the cities, he went down also to the saints who dwelt in Lud the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found a certain man whose name was Ania, who had lain upon a bed paralyzed eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Shemun said to him, Ania, Jeshu Meshiha healeth thee; arise, and make thy bed. And instantly he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And all who dwelt in Lud and in Sarona saw him, and turned to Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>BUT there was a certain disciple in Joppa the city, whose name was Tabitha. This was rich in good works and in alms which she had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>But she became afflicted in those days, and died. And they washed her and laid her in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And the disciples heard that Shemun was in Lud the city, because it is over against Joppa, and they sent to him two men, who should pray of him not to delay to come among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>And Shemun arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him up to the upper room, and assembled (and) stood around him all the widows, weeping, and showing him those vestments and mantles which Tabitha had given them, while living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Shemun put forth all the men without, and fell upon his knees and prayed; and he turned towards the corpse and said Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>and when she beheld Shemun, she sat. And he reached his hand and raised her, and called the saints and widows, and gave her to them living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And this was known to all the city, and many believed in our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>BUT in Cesarea was a certain man, a centurion, whose name was Cornelius, of the cohort which was called the Italic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>And he was just, and feared Aloha, he and all his house: he did much alms among the people, and in all time prayed of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>This saw an angel of Aloha in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the day, who came in to him, and said to him, Cornelius!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And he beheld him, and feared, and said, What, my Lord? And the angel said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms have ascended for a memorial before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa the city, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>behold, he sojourneth in the house of Shemun the tanner, which is hard by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who had spoken with him had gone, he called two from the sons of his house, and a certain soldier who feared Aloha (and) who was obedient to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and he made known to them every thing he had seen, and sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>AND the day after while they went on the way, and drew nigh to the city, Shemun ascended to the roof to pray, at the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he hungered, and desired to eat: and while they were preparing for him, there fell upon him an entrancement,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and he saw the heavens opened, and a certain vessel bound at the four corners, and like to a great sheet, and it was let down from heaven upon the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>and in it were all animals of four feet, and reptiles of the earth, and fowls of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, which said, Shemun, arise, slay, and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>And Shemun said, Not so, my Lord: for never have I eaten any thing that is profane and unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And again the second time was to him, Those (things) which Aloha cleanseth make not thou profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was three times done: and the vessel was elevated to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>And while Shemun wondered in himself for what (was) the vision he had seen, those men came who had been sent by Cornelius, and inquired for the house where Shemun sojourned, and they came and stood at the gate of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And they called there, and inquired, whether Shemun who was called Kipha there sojourned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And while Shemun thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>arise, descend and go with them, not being divided in thy mind: for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Shemun descended to those men, and said to them, I am he whom you seek: what is the occasion on which you have come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They said to him, A certain man whose name is Cornelius, a centurion, who feareth Aloha, and of whom all the people of the Jihudoyee give witness, hath been told in a vision by an holy angel to send and bring thee to his house, and to hear words from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>And Shemun brought them in, and received them while they tarried; and he arose the day after, and went forth, and proceeded with them; and certain of the brethren of Joppa went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the next day they entered Cesarea: but Cornelius was waiting for them, while all the sons of his family, and the friends and beloved ones whom he had, were assembled with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>AND when Shemun entered Cornelius met him, and fell and worshipped at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>And Shemun raised him, and said to him, Arise, I also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And while speaking with him he entered, and found many who had come thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, You know that it is not lawful for a man a Jihudoya to attach to a foreign man who is not a son of his tribe. But me hath Aloha showed that I should not declare any man unclean or profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Wherefore I the more diligently came when you sent for me. But I ask you, on what account you have sent for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said to him, Four days are unto this from when, behold, I am fasting; and at nine hours, while praying in my house, a certain man stood before me clothed in white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>And he said to me, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms have made memorial before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>But send to Joppa the city, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha; behold, he abideth in the house of Shemun a tanner, which is by the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>and he will come and speak with thee. And immediately I sent to thee, and thou hast well done to have come. And, behold, we are all before thee, and desire to hear every thing that hath been commanded thee by Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>BUT Shemun opened his mouth, and said, In truth I comprehend that Aloha is no respecter of persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in all nations whoever feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>For (this is) the word which he hath sent to the sons of Israel, and hath announced to them peace and repose through Jeshu Meshiha,-this is the Lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>And you also know by the word which hath been in all Jihud (which began) from Galila after the baptism which Juhanon preached,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>concerning Jeshu who was of Natsrath, whom Aloha anointed with the Spirit of Holiness and with power: he who went about and healed those who were worn out with evil, because Aloha was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are his witnesses of all which he did in the land of Jihud and of Urishlem. This (one) himself did the Jihudoyee hang upon the tree and kill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>and him did Aloha raise up on the third day, and gave him to be seen openly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>yet not to all the people, but to us who by Aloha were chosen to be unto him the witnesses, who ate with him and drank after his resurrection from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us to preach and to testify to the people that this is he who hath been separated by Aloha (to be) the Judge of the living and of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>And of him all the prophets testify, that whoever believeth in his name shall receive remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>And while Shemun spake these words the Spirit of Holiness overspread all who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And the circumcised brethren who had come with him were astonished and amazed, because upon the Gentiles also the gift of the Spirit of Holiness was poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking with tongues; and they magnified Aloha. And Shemun said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Can any one forbid waters that they should not be baptized, they who, behold, have received the Spirit of Holiness as well as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>Then he commanded them to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. And they prayed of him to remain with them (certain) days.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>And the apostles and brethren who were in Jihud heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>AND when Shemun had gone up to Urishlem, they who were of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, that unto men uncircumcised he had entered, and had eaten with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>And Shemun put forth in order to say to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>That while praying in Joppa I saw a vision; a certain vessel descended which was like to a sheet, and bound at the four corners: and it came down from heaven and came unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>And gazing at it I beheld in it animals of four feet, and reptiles of the earth, and fowls of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice which said to me, Shemun, arise, slay, and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>And I said, Not so, my Lord; for nothing hath entered my mouth that is unclean or profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>And again the voice said to me from heaven, What Aloha hath cleansed make not thou to be polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This was done three times, and every thing was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And at that moment three men, who had been sent to me by Cornelius from Cesarea, came and stood at the gate of the court where I was sojourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit said to me, Go with them without doubting. And there went also with me these six brethren, and we entered into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he related to us how he had seen in his house an angel, who stood and said to him, Send to the city Joppa, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And when I proceeded to speak there, the Spirit of Holiness overshadowed them, as upon us from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the word of our Lord, who said, Juhanon baptized you with waters, but you shall be baptized with the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then Aloha equally hath given the gift to the Gentiles who have believed in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha as we, who was I, that I should be sufficient to prohibit Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And when these words they had heard they were silent, and they praised Aloha, and said, Now also unto the Gentiles Aloha hath given repentance unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>BUT they who had been dispersed by the tribulation that was concerning Estephanos went unto Punika, also to the region of Kypros and to Antiokia, but with any one not speaking the word unless only with the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But of them were men of Kypros and of Kyrine; these entered into Antiokia, and discoursed with the Javnoyee, and evangelized concerning our Lord Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and many believed, and were converted unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And this was heard by the ears of the sons of the church which was at Urishlem, and they sent Bar Naba to Antiokia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>And when he came thither, and beheld the grace of Aloha, he rejoiced, and entreated them with all their heart to cleave to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, and full of the Spirit of Holiness and of faith, and there was added much people to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>And he went forth to Tarsos to seek for Shaol;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and when he had found him he brought him with him to Antiokia. And a whole year together they assembled in the church, and taught much people: from thence first in Antiokia the disciples were called Christianee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And he went forth, and came after him; not knowing that what was done by the hand of the angel was reality, for he thought that he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And when he had passed the first and second guard, they came to the gate of iron, and it was opened to them of its own accord. And when they went forth and had passed one street, the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>Then acknowledged Shemun, and said, Now know I in truth that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me from the hand of Herodes the king, and from that which the Jihudoyee had calculated against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And when he had understood, he came to the house of Mariam the mother of Juhanon, he who is surnamed Markos; because many brethren were assembled there and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And he knocked at the gate of the court, and there came forth to answer him a damsel whose name was Roda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And she knew the voice of Shemun; and for joy she opened not the gate, but returned with running, and said to them, Shemun, behold, stands at the gate of the court.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>And he beckoned to them with his hand to be silent; and entered, and showed them how the Lord had brought him out from the house of the bound. And he said to them, Show these to Jakub and to the brethren; and he departed and went to another place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>he said to him with a high voice, To thee I say, in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, Stand upon thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And leaping, he stood and walked. And the assembly of the people, when they saw what Paulos had done, lifted up their voice in the language of the country, and said, Gods in the likeness of men have come down unto us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And when there had been much investigation, Shemun arose, and said to them, Men, brethren, you know that from the first days from my mouth did Aloha choose that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And she was baptized, she and the sons of her house. And she besought us and said, If it be that you truly think that I have believed in our Lord, come, remain in my house; and she constrained us much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>AND it was while we went to the house of prayer, a certain damsel met us in whom was a spirit of divination, and she had produced her lords much gain by her divination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>And she came after Paulos and after us, and cried and said, These men are the servants of Aloha the Most High, and announce to us the way of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And this she did many days. And Paulos was indignant, and said to that spirit, I command thee in the name of Jeshu Meshiha to come out of her. And in that hour it came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>And when her lords saw that the hope of their gain had gone from her, they laid hold on Paulos and Shilo and drew them to the public place, and brought them unto the prefects and to the chiefs of the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>and said, These men are troubling our city, because they are Jihudoyee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and are preaching to us those rites which it is not permitted us to receive and perform, because we are Rumoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And a great gathering assembled against them. Then the prefects rent their vestments, and commanded to scourge them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And when they had scourged them much, they cast them into the house of the bound, and commanded the keeper of the house of the bound to keep them watchfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>But he, having received this command, brought in and shut them in the inner house of the house of the bound, and fastened their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>And in the dividing of the night, Paulos and Shilo prayed and glorified Aloha, and the chained-ones heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly there was a great trembling, and the foundations of the house of the bound trembled, and at once the doors of all were opened, and the chains of all were loosened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And when the keeper of the house of the bound awoke, and saw that the doors of the house of the bound were open, he took a sword and sought to kill himself, because he thought that the chained-ones had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>And Paulos cried with a high voice and said to him, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And he kindled for himself a lamp, and sprang, and came, perturbed, and fell at the feet of Paulos and of Shilo:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and he brought them without, and said to them, My lords, what behoveth me to do that I may be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said to him, Believe in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke with him the words of the Lord, and with all the sons of his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And in the same hour of that night, he took and washed them from their stripes, and was forthwith baptized, and all the sons of his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And he took and brought them up into his house, and set for them the table, and exulted, he and the sons of his house, in the faith of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And when it was morning the prefects sent to the bearers of rods to say to the chief of the house of the bound, Loose those men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>AND when the chief of the house of the bound heard, he entered and spoke that word to Paulos, that the prefects have sent that you might he dismissed; and now go forth (and) proceed in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>Paulos saith to him, They scourged us in the eyes of the world, (we) being innocent, (and) Roman men, and threw us into the house of the bound; and now would they bring us forth secretly? No, indeed, but they shall come and bring us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the bearers of rods went and told the prefects these words which had been spoken to them. And when they heard that they were Rumoyee, they feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And they came to them, and besought them to come forth and depart from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And when they had gone forth from the house of the bound, they entered with Lydia, and there saw the brethren, and consoled them. And they went forth</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>and passed by Amphipolis and Apolonia, cities, and came to Thessalonika, where was a synagogue of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>AND Paulos entered, as his custom was, with them, and three shabaths spoke to them from the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>expounding, and showing, That Meshiha was to suffer and to rise from the house of the dead, and he is Jeshu the Meshiha whom I preach to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And men of them believed and adhered to Paulos and Shilo, and many of the Javnoyee who feared Aloha, and distinguished women not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>And the Jihudoyee envied, and joined to them evil men from the public place of the city, and made a great multitude, and conturbed the city.

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>And when they could not find them there, they drew Jason and the brethren who were there, and brought them to the chiefs of the city, crying, These are they who have troubled the whole land; and behold again have they come here;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>and their receiver is this Jason; and all these against the commands of Cesar are risen, in saying that there is another king, Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And the chiefs of the city and all the people were troubled when they heard these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>and they took pledges from Jason and also from the brethren, and then dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>But the brethren immediately in that night dismissed Paulos and Shilo unto Beroa the city; and when they were come thither they entered into the synagogue of the Jihudoyee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>for more noble were those Jihudoyee who were there than those Jihudoyee who were in Thessalonika; and they heard from them the word daily with joy, while they decided from the scriptures whether these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>And many of them believed, and so also of the Javnoyee, men many, and distinguished women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>And when those Jihudoyee who were of Thessalonika knew that the word of Aloha was preached by Paulos in Beroa the city, they came there also, and ceased not to move and trouble the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>And the brethren dismissed Paulos that he should go down by sea; and Shilo and Timotheos remained in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>AND they who accompanied Paulos came unto Athinos the city; and when they departed from the midst of it they took from him an epistle to Shilo and Timotheos, that they should speedily come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>But he, Paulos, while he waited in Athinos, was embittered in his spirit, (for he) saw how the whole city was filled with idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>And he spake in the synagogue with the Jihudoyee, and with those who worshipped Aloha, and in the public place with those who met there daily;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>and the philosophers also who were of the doctrine of Epikuros, and others who were called Estoiku, disputed with him. And some of them said, What willeth this accumulator of words? And others said, He preaches foreign gods; because Jeshu and his resurrection he preached unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took him and brought him to the house of judgment which is called Arios-pagos, saying to him, Can we know what this new doctrine is which thou art preaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>for thou sowest foreign words in our hearing, and we desire to know what these things are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>But all the Athinoyee, and those foreigners who are there, of no other thing are careful, but to say and to hear something new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>AND as Paulos stood on Arios-pagos he said, Men of Athinos, I observe you that in all (things) you exceed in the worship of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>As I walked about and saw the place of your worship, I found a certain altar on which was inscribed, To GOD THE HIDDEN: him then whom while not known you worship, This I declare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>For ALOHA who made the world and all that is in it, and is himself the Lord of heaven and of earth, in temples made with hands resideth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Neither is he served by the hands of men, nor needeth he any thing, for it is he who giveth to every man life and soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And of one blood hath he made the whole world of men to dwell upon the face of all the earth, and he hath distinguished the times by his decree, and set the limits of the dwelling of mankind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they should seek Aloha and inquire, and from his creatures find himself, because he is not far from every one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in him we live, and are moved, and are; as also one of your sages hath said, From him is our descent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Men, therefore, whose descent is from Aloha, should not think that gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and skill of man is like the Divinity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>For the times of error Aloha hath made to pass away; and in this time he commandeth all men, that every man in every place should repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he hath set a day in which he will judge the whole earth in righteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained; and he will convert every man to the faith of him in having raised him from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard of resurrection from among the dead, (some) of them mocked, and (some) of them said, At another time we will hear thee concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And so Paulos went forth from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>And certain of them adhered to him and believed: but one of them was Dionosios of the judges of Arios-pagos, and a certain woman whose name was Damaris, and others with them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>AND when Paulos had gone forth from Athinos, he came unto Kurinthos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And he found there a certain man, a Jihudoya, whose name was Akilos, who was from the country of Pontos, (and) who at that time had come from the country of Italia, himself and Priskila his wife, because Klaudios Cesar had commanded that all the Jihudoyee should go out from Ruma; and he drew near to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>(and) because he was a son of their art, he dwelt with them and wrought with them: but in their art they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he discoursed in the synagogue every shabath, and persuaded the Jihudoyee and the Heathens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when from Makedunia Shilo and Timotheos had come, Paulos was constrained in his speech, because the Jihudoyee arose against him and blasphemed, while he testified to them that Jeshu is the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>And he shook his garments and said to them, From now I am clean: I go unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And he went forth from thence, and entered into the house of a man named Titos, who worshipped Aloha; and his house adjoined the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Krispos, master of the synagogue, believed in our Lord, he and all the sons of his house. And many of the Kurinthoyee heard and believed in Aloha, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord said in a vision unto Paulos, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>for I am with thee, and no man can do thee harm; and I have much people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>But he abode a year and six months in Kurinthos, and taught them the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>AND when Galion was proconsul of Akaia, they gathered together against Paulos, and brought him before the tribunal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This (man) part from the law persuadeth men to worship Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paulos sought to open his mouth and speak, Galion said to the Jihudoyee, If it were concerning some thing of evil, or of wickedness, or of abomination, you would complain, O Jihudoyee, it would be proper for me to receive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but if they be questions concerning language and names, and concerning your law, let them be known among yourselves; for I am not willing to be a judge of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from his tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>And all the Heathens seized Sosthenis the presbyter of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal. And Galion was careless of these.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And they came to Ephesos. And Paulos entered the synagogue and discoursed with the Jihudoyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>and they requested of him to tarry with them; and he was not willing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>for he said, It behoveth me faithfully to perform the feast which cometh at Urishlem; and if Aloha willeth, I will come again to you. And Akilos and Priskila he left at Ephesos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>and he voyaged by sea and came to Cesarea: and he went up and wished the peace of the sons of the church, and went unto Antiokia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And when he had been there certain days, he went forth and itinerated successively through Phrygia and Galatia, confirming all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>And a certain man whose name was Apolu, a Jihudoya, who was by family of Aleksandria, and erudite in speech, and accurate in the scriptures, came to Ephesos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This was discipled in the way of the Lord, and was fervid in spirit, and he spake and taught freely concerning Jeshu, while knowing not any thing but the baptism of Juhanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began boldly to speak in the synagogue. And when Akilos and Priskila heard him, they brought him to their house, and fully showed to him the way of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he willed to go to Akaia, the brethren were careful of him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had gone he helped much, through grace, all the believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he disputed forcibly against the Jihudoyee before the assemblies, while he showed from the scriptures concerning Jeshu, that he is the Meshiha.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>AND while Apolu was in Kurinthos, Paulos itinerated through the upper countries unto Ephesos; and he asked those disciples whom he found there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>Have you received the Spirit of Holiness from that you believed? They answered and said to him, It hath not been heard by us whether there be the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He saith to them, And into what were you baptized? They said, Into the baptism of Juhanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Paulos saith to them, Juhanon baptized the people with the baptism of repentance, saying that they should believe in him who was coming after him, who is Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>And men of them were obdurate, and contended, and reviled the way of Aloha, before the assembly of the people. Then Paulos removed and separated from them the disciples, and every day discoursed with them in the school of a man whose name was Tyranos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this was done two years, until all who dwelt in Asia, Jihudoyee and Aramoyee, had heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And great power-works wrought Aloha by the hand of Paulos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that they brought even from the garments that were upon his body napkins or wrappings, and laid them upon the sick, and the diseases went from them; and demons also went forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>BUT men, Jihudoyee, also, who went about and adjured demons, willed to adjure in the name of our Lord Jeshu over those who had unclean spirits, saying, We adjure you in the name of Jeshu whom Paulos preacheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There were seven sons of a man, a certain Jihudoya, chief of the priests, whose name was Skeva, who did this.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom was the evil spirit sprang upon them, and was strong against them, and threw them, and they, naked and wounded, fled from that house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all the Jihudoyee and Aramoyee who dwelt in Ephesos: and fear fell upon them all, and the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha was exalted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many also of the magicians collected their writings and brought and burned them before all men; and they reckoned the price of them, and it ascended to silver five myriads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>And thus with great power prevailed and increased the faith of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>But when these were fulfilled, Paulos set in his mind to itinerate throughout all Makedunia and Akaia, and to go into Urishlem. And he said, When I shall have gone thither, it behoveth me Ruma also to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And he sent two men of those who ministered to him to Makedunia, Timotheos and Aristos; but he remained a time in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>BUT there was made at that time a great tumult on account of the way of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For there was a certain worker of silver there whose name was Dimitrios, who made shrines of silver of Artemis, and he produced for the sons of his art great gains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>This (man) assembled all the sons of his art and those who wrought with them, and said to them, Men, you know that all our merchandise is from this work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you also hear and see, that not only the sons of Ephesos, but also many of all Asia, this Paulos persuadeth, and hath perverted them, saying, that there be no gods which by the hands of men are made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>And not only is this business defamed and brought to an end, but also the temple of Artemis the great goddess is reputed as nothing, and she also, the goddess of all Asia, and (whom) all the nations worship, is despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And when they heard these (words) they were filled with wrath; and they cried, and said, Great is Artemis of the Ephesoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was perturbed, and they ran together and came to the theatre; and seizing, they led with them Gaios and Aristarkos, men of Makedunia, companions of Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>AND Paulos willed to enter the theatre, and the disciples restrained him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And the chiefs of Asia, because they were his friends, sent, praying of him not to deliver himself by going into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>But the crowd who were in the theatre were greatly commoved, and others cried other things; for many of them knew not on what account they were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>But the people of the Jihudoyee who were there appointed of them a man a Jihudoya, whose name was Aleksandros; and when he stood (forth) he signed that he would apologize to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>And when they knew that he was a Jihudoya, all of them cried with one voice, as two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesoyee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And the chief of the city stilled them, saying, Men, Ephesoyee, who is there of mankind who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesoyee is a votaress of the great Artemis, and of her image which descended from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Therefore, since no man can contradict this, it behoves you to be silent, and to do nothing in haste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>Yet have you brought these men who have neither spoiled temples nor blasphemed our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>But if this Dimitrios and the sons of his craft have strife with any man, behold, the proconsul is in the city, (and) there are officers: let them go nigh and judge one with another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>AND on the first day in the week, when we were assembled to break the eucharist, Paulos discoursed with them, because the day following he was to depart; and he prolonged his discourse until the dividing of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were many lamps of fire in the high-room where we were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain youth whose name was Eutikos sat in a window and heard. And he had sunk into a heavy sleep while Paulos prolonged his discourse, and in his sleep he fell from the third floor, and was taken up as dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>And Paulos descended, and fell upon him and embraced him, and said, Be not agitated, for his life is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>When he had gone up, he broke bread and tasted, speaking with them until the morning arose; and then went he forth to proceed by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the young man alive, and rejoiced over him greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we went down to the ship, and voyaged to the port of Thesos, because there we were to receive Paulos, for thus he had instructed us, while he himself would proceed by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>But when we had received him from Thesos, we took him up into the ship and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And from thence the day after we voyaged over against Kios the island, and again the day after we came to Samos; and we tarried at Trogalium, and the day after we came to Militos:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>for Paulos had decided with himself to pass by Ephesos, that he might not be hindered there, because he hastened, that, if it were possible, on the day of the Pentecost in Urishlem he might work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>AND from Militos he sent to bring the presbyters of the church of Ephesos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>and when they came to him, he said to them: You know, that from the first day that I entered Asia, how I was with you all time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving Aloha in much lowliness and with tears, and in those temptations which passed upon me through the devices of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>Neither neglected I any thing that was profitable for your souls, that I might preach to you and teach in public places and in houses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>while I testified to Jihudoyee and to Aramoyee concerning repentance that is toward Aloha, and faith which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now I, bound in the Spirit, go to Urishlem; not knowing what I shall know in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>Nevertheless, the Spirit of Holiness in every city testifieth to me and saith, that bonds and afflictions are for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But by me my life is reckoned nothing, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry I have received from our Lord Jeshu, to bear witness concerning the gospel of the grace of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now, I know that again my face you will not see, you, all, among whom I have gone about, preaching to you the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>I testify to you this very day, that I am pure from the blood of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I have not shunned to make known to you all the will of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to the whole flock over which the Spirit of Holiness hath constituted you the bishops; to pasture the church of the Meshiha which he hath purchased with his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>For I know that after I shall have gone, there will enter with you furious wolves which will not spare the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>And also from you, of yourselves, will men arise speaking perverse things to turn away disciples to go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>On account of this be watchful, and remember, that for three years I ceased not by night and by day with tears to instruct every one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now I commend you to Aloha, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance with all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>Silver, or gold, or raiment have I not coveted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>and you know to the necessity of myself, and of those who are with me, these hands have ministered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>And I have shown you every thing, (that) so it behoveth to labour, and to be careful of those who are infirm, and to remember the word of our Lord Jeshu, that he said, He is blessed who giveth, more than he who receiveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And when these he had said, he kneeled on his knees and prayed, and all the men with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And there was a great weeping with all of them, and they embraced him and kissed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>but most agonized (were they) by that word which he had spoken, that again they were not to see his face. And they accompanied him to the ship.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seventh day was come the Jihudoyee who were from Asia saw him in the temple, and stirred up against him all the people. And they lifted their hands against him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had before seen with him Trophimus the Ephesian in the city, and supposed that with Paulos he had entered the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was commoved, and all the people assembled, and they laid hold of Paulos, and dragged him without from the temple; and instantly the gates were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And while the multitude sought to kill him, the tribune of the cohort heard that the whole city was agitated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>And forthwith took he a centurion and many soldiers and ran upon them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they desisted from beating Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>And the tribune drew near and took him, and commanded them to bind him with two chains. And he asked concerning him who (he was), and what he had done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And men from the crowd cried against him variously, and because of their crying he was not able to know what was the truth; and he commanded that they should lead him to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And as Paulos came to the stairs the soldiers carried him, on account of the violence of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for after him was much people; and they cried, and said, Away with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as they came to enter into the fortress, Paulos himself said to the tribune, May I be permitted to speak to the people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>But he said to him, Javanith knowest thou? Art thou not that Metsroya who before these days stirred up and led forth into the waste four thousand men workers of evils?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>Paulos said to him, I am a man a Jihudoya from Tarsos of Cilicia, an illustrious city in which I was born: I pray you permit me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And when he had permitted him, Paulos stood upon the stairs, and signed to them with his hand; and when they had ceased, he spoke to them in Hebrew, and said to them,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Brethren and fathers, hear the defence which I make to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And when they heard that Hebrew he was speaking with them, the more they ceased; and he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>I am a man a Jihudoya; and I was born in Tarsos of Cilicia, but was brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed perfectly in the law of our fathers. And I was zealous for Aloha, even as all of you are also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>And this way I persecuted unto the death, while I bound and delivered to the house of the bound both men and women;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as the chief of the priests can testify of me, and all the elders, that from them I received letters to go to the brethren who were in Darmsuk, that also them who were there I should bring to Urishlem bound, that they might be fined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And as I went, and began to approach Darmsuk in the dividing of the day, suddenly from heaven there shone upon me a great light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>and I fell upon the earth, and heard a voice, which said to me, Shaol, Shaol, why persecutest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>But I answered and said, Who art thou, my Lord? And he said to me, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And the men who were with me saw the light, but the voice they understood not which spake with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, What shall I do, my Lord? And he said to me, Arise, go into Darmsuk, and there shall it be told thee of whatever it is commanded thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And while I could not see because of the glory of that light, they who were with me took me by my hands, and I entered Darmsuk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And a man, one Hanania, righteous in the law, as the Jihudoyee who were there testified of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me, and said to me, Shaol, my brother, open thine eyes. And in a moment my eyes were opened, and I beheld him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said to me, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see that Just One, and to hear the voice from his lips,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>that thou mayest be a witness to all men of all that thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why delayest thou? Arise, baptize, and be washed from thy sins, while thou callest his Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And being returned, I came hither to Urishlem. And I prayed in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>And I saw him in a vision, when he said to me, Hasten, and remove thee from Urishlem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, My Lord, they know also how I delivered to the house of the bound, and smote in all the synagogues, those who have believed in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of thy martyr Estephanos was shed, I also stood with them, and fulfilled the will of his murderers, and kept the garments of them who stoned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said to me, Go: for I send thee far away to preach to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And when they had heard Paulos until this word, they lifted up their voice, and cried, Take from the earth one like this; for he ought not to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they shouted and cast their garments and threw dust to the heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the tribune commanded that he should be brought into the fortress, and commanded him to be questioned by scourging, that he might know for what cause they cried against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they exposed him with thongs, Paulos said to the centurion who stood near him, Is it allowed you to scourge a Roman man who is not condemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And when the centurion heard, he approached the tribune, and said to him, What doest thou? For this is a Roman man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And the tribune approached him, and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said to him, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>The tribune answered, and said to him, I with much money purchased the Roman-right. Paulos said to him, But I was born in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>And immediately those who had sought to scourge him desisted from him; and the tribune feared when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>AND the day after he willed to know truly what was the accusation which the Jihudoyee brought against him. And he ordered him and commanded the great priests and all the synagogue of their rulers to come; and he took Paulos and brought (him) down, and stood him among them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paulos, looking upon their assembly, said, Men, brethren, I in all good conscience have conversed before Aloha, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And Hanania the priest commanded them who stood by him to smite Paulos upon his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>And Paulos said to him, It will be that Aloha will smite thee, (thou) whitened wall: thou sittest to judge me according to the law, while thou transgressest the law, and commandest that they smite me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And they who stood there said to him, The priest of Aloha revilest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paulos said to them, I knew not, my brethren, that he is the priest; for it is written, Of the chief of thy people thou shalt not speak evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>And when Paulos knew that (part) of the people were of the Zadukoyee and (part) of it of the Pharishee, he cried in the assembly, Men, my brethren, I am a Pharisha, the son of Pharishee; and for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had said this, the Pharishee and the Zadukoyee fell on one another, and the people was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Zadukoyee say that there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor spirit; but the Pharishee confess all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was made a great noise. And certain sophree of the choice of the Pharishee arose and contended with them, and said, We have not found any thing of evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken with him, what is there in this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And when there was a great commotion among them, the tribune feared lest they should tear Paulos in pieces, and he sent to the Rumoyee to come and carry him away from the midst of them, and take him into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And when it was night our Lord appeared unto Paulos, and said to him, Be strong: for as thou hast testified of me in Urishlem, so is it to be that thou also in Ruma shalt testify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>AND when it became morning, men of the Jihudoyee gathered and bound a vow upon themselves, that they would not eat or drink till they had killed Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>But there were of those who established by oath this compact more than forty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they drew nigh to the priests and to the elders, and said, A vow we have vowed upon us, that nothing will we taste until we have killed Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>And now do you and the princes of the synagogue request from the tribune to bring him to you, as if you sought to investigate more truly his work, and we are prepared to kill him while he shall come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>And the son of the sister of Paulos heard this plot, and he entered the fortress and informed Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paulos sent (and) called one of the centurions, and said to him, Bring this youth to the tribune, for he has somewhat to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>And the centurion conducted the youth, and introduced him to the tribune, and said, Paulos the prisoner called me, and requested of me to bring this youth to thee, because he hath somewhat to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the tribune took the youth by his hand, and led him on one side, and asked him, What hast thou to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And the youth said to him, The Jihudoyee have determined to request of thee to send down Paulos, tomorrow, to their synagogue, as if willing to learn somewhat more from him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>thou therefore yield not to them; for, behold, more than forty men of them watch for him in ambush, and have bound a curse upon themselves, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and, behold, they are ready, and wait thy promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>And the tribune dismissed the youth, when he had admonished him, Let no man know that these thou hast informed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And he called two centurions, and said to them, Go, prepare two hundred Romans to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen and right-handed spearmen two hundred, to go forth at the third hour of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>but provide also a beast to carry Paulos, and escape to Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter, and gave it to them, which was thus:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>The Jihudoyee had seized this man to kill him; and I arose with the Romans and rescued him, when I had learned that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And when I sought to know the occasion of which they accused him, I brought him down to their synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>And I found that concerning questions of their law they accused him; and a cause worthy of bonds or of death was not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was told me of the treachery of a plot which the Jihudoyee wrought against him, I straightway sent him to thee; and I have commanded his accusers to come and speak with him before thee. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Then the Rumoyee, as they had been commanded, took Paulos by night, and brought him to Antipatros the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>and the day after the horsemen sent away their foot-companions to return to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>And they came to Cesarea. And they gave the letter to the governor, and made Paulos stand before him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>AND after five days Hanania the great priest came down with the elders, and with Tartelos a rhetor, and informed the governor against Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And being called, Tartelos came forth to accuse him, and said, For many years have we dwelt (in peace) through thee, and many reformations have been made for this people in the bearing of thy office;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>and all we in every place receive thy bounty, victorious Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But, not to weary thee with many (words), I pray thee to hear our humbleness with brevity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man to be a destroyer, and an exciter of agitation among all the Jihudoyee, and in all the land: for he is a chief of the doctrine of the Natsroyee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>and he willed to pollute our temple; and having apprehended him, we sought to judge him according to our law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>but Lusios the tribune came, and with great force transferred him from our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>and hath sent him unto thee, and commanded his accusers to come to thee; and thou canst by questioning him learn from him concerning all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jihudoyee themselves also contended against him, saying, that so these things were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>And the governor signed to Paulos to speak. And Paulos answered, and said, For many years I know that thou hast been the judge of this people, and on this account I joyfully make defence for myself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>while thou shouldst know that it hath not been more than twelve days since I went up to Urishlem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>Neither found they me speaking with any man in the temple, neither have I gathered an assembly in their synagogue nor in the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>nor is it in their power to demonstrate before thee any thing of what they accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>Nevertheless, this do I confess, that in that very doctrine of which they speak, in it serve I the God of my fathers, believing in all that is written in the law and in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>and having hope in Aloha that which they also hope: that there shall be a resurrection from the house of the dead, of the just and of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>Because of this also I labour to have a good conscience before Aloha and before men, continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>But after many years I came to the sons of my people to bestow alms, and to present an oblation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>And these found me in the temple being purified, not with a concourse nor with tumult; but men Jihudoyee who had come from Asia raised a tumult;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>(and) these it behoved to stand with me before thee, and to accuse of that whatever they have (against me).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these themselves declare, what crime they found in me, when I stood before their assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless for this one word which I proclaimed while standing in the midst of them, For the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>But Felix, because he knew this way fully, delayed them, saying, When the tribune comes I will hear between you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paulos in quietude, and that none of his acquaintances should be hindered from ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after a few days Felix, and Drusilla his wife, who was a Jihudoytha, sent and called Paulos, and they heard from him concerning the faith of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he discoursed with them of righteousness, and of holiness, and of the judgment which is to come, Felix was filled with fear, and he said, Now go, and when I have opportunity I will send for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>For he hoped that a bribe would be given him by Paulos, and on this account he continually sent to bring him, and to speak with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>And when two years were fulfilled to him, another governor came in his place, who was called Porcios Festos. But Felix, as to do a favour to the Jihudoyee, left Paulos bound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>And when Festos came to Cesarea, after three days he went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the chief priest and elders showed him concerning Paulos, and besought from him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking of him this favour, that he would bring him to Urishlem, while they would act treacherously in the way by killing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>And Festos returned the word, That Paulos was kept in Cesarea, and I am hastening to proceed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>let those therefore of you who are able, go down with us, and accuse him of whatever guilt there is in the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And when he had been there eight days or ten, he went down to Cesarea. And the day after he sat on the tribunal, and commanded to bring Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he had come, the Jihudoyee who had come down from Urishlem surrounded him, and accusations many and hard brought against him, which they were not able to prove;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while Paulos put forth the mind, that he had not offended in any thing, neither against the law of the Jihudoyee, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festos, because he willed to accord a favour to the Jihudoyee, said to Paulos, Art thou willing to go up to Urishlem, and there concerning these things to be judged before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Paulos answered, and said, At the tribunal of Caesar stand I. There it is right for me to be judged. Not any thing have I transgressed against the Jihudoyee, as also thou knowest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>and if a crime I have committed, or any thing worthy of death, I ask not (to be exempted) from death. But, if there be nothing in me of which these accuse me, no man shall give me to them as a gift. I invoke the appeals of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festos, having spoken with the sons of his council, said, The appeals of Caesar hast thou invoked? To Caesar goest thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>AND when days had been, Agripos the king and Bernike came down to Cesarea to salute Festos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had been with him (some) days, Festos recounted to the king the judgment of Paulos, saying, A certain man has been left bound by Felix;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>and when I was at Urishlem, the chief priests and elders of the Jihudoyee informed me against him, and begged that I would do for them judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>And I told them, it was not the custom of the Romans to give any man as a gift to be killed, until his adversaries have come and accused him to his face, and there be given him place to defend himself against that of which he is accused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>And when I had come hither, without delay, the day after I sat on the tribunal, and commanded to bring the man to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>And his accusers stood up with him, but could not find any evil accusation to prove against him, (such) as I had expected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but (had) various questions with him regarding their worship, and concerning Jeshu, a man who was dead, of whom Paulos said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And because I stood not upon the investigation of these (matters), I said to Paulos, Dost thou require to go to Urishlem, and there be judged concerning these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But he required to be kept unto the judgment of Caesar; and I commanded that he should be kept until I may send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>And Agripos said, I would hear this man. And Festos said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>And the day after came Agripos and Bernike with great pomp, and entered the house of judgment, with the tribunes and the chiefs of the city. And Festos commanded, and Paulos came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festos said, King Agripos, and all men who are with us, concerning this man whom you see have all the people of the Jihudoyee taken me at Urishlem and here, crying, that This ought not further to live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>but I perceived not that he had done any thing worthy of death. And because he required to be reserved for the judgment of Caesar, I have commanded that he should be sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>But (as) I know not what to write of him unto Caesar, therefore have I willed to bring him before you, and especially before thee, king Agripos, that, having inquired into his case, I may find what to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it is not fit when we send a man bound, not to record his transgression.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>And Agripos said to Paulos, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paulos stretched forth his hand and made defence, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>Of all that I am accused by the Jihudoyee, king Agripos, I consider myself happy, that before you I (have to) make defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>Especially because I know that you are conversant with all questions and laws of the Jihudoyee; therefore, I pray you with patient mind to hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>For the Jihudoyee themselves-if they would testify-know my manners from my youth, which were mine from the beginning among my people at Urishlem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>because they of a long time were assured of me, and they know that in the high doctrine of the Pharishee I lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now, concerning the hope of the promise that was made to our fathers by Aloha, stand I, and am judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>And for this hope (to which) our twelve tribes, with diligent prayers by day and night, are expecting to come, for this very hope am I accused by the Jihudoyee, king Agripos!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>What judge you; ought we not to believe that Aloha will raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>For I, at the first, proposed in my mind to do many things against the name of Jeshu Natsroya.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>This I also did in Urishlem. And many holy ones I cast into the house of the bound, by the authority which I had received from the great priests; and when they were killed by them, I participated with those who condemned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And in every synagogue I was furious against them, while I constrained them to blaspheme the name of Jeshu; and, being filled with great wrath against them, I went forth unto other cities also to persecute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>And while going on this account to Darmsuk, with authority and permission from the great priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at the dividing of the day, in the way, I saw from heaven, O king, shining upon me and upon all who were with me, a light which (was) more excellent than the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And we fell all of us upon the earth; and I heard a voice that said to me in Hebrew, Shaol, Shaol, why persecutest thou me? It is hard to thee to kick against the pricks!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, my Lord? And he said, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>And he said to me, Stand upon thy feet, because for this I have appeared to thee, to appoint thee a minister and witness of that (for) which thou hast seen me, and (for) which thou shalt see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>And I will deliver thee from the people of the Jihudoyee, and from the other nations to whom I send thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto Aloha, and receive the forgiveness of sins, and a lot with the saints through faith, which (is) in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>Wherefore, king Agripos, I withstood not with perversity the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but preached, at first to them who were in Darmsuk, and to them who were at Urishlem, and in all the districts of Jihud, and also to the Gentiles have I preached, that they should repent, and turn to Aloha, and do works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>And for these things the Jihudoyee seized me in the temple, and would have killed me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>but Aloha hath helped me until this day; and, behold, I stand and testify to the small and to the great, yet nothing beyond Musha and the prophets do I speak, but those things which they said should come to pass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Meshiha should suffer, and should be the chief of the resurrection from the house of the dead, and should preach light to the people and to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>AND as Paulos was thus making defence, Festos cried with a high voice, Thou art mad, Paulos; much learning hath made thee mad!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>Paulos said to him, I am not mad, victorious Festos, but words of truth and righteousness I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>And king Agripos also, especially, knoweth concerning these things; and therefore speak I with openness before him; because not one of these things I think have been hidden from him; for they were not done in secrecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>Believest thou, king Agripos, the prophets? I know that thou believest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>King Agripos said to him, (Within) a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paulos said, I would from Aloha that in little and in much, not only thou, but also all who hear me to-day, were as I am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernike, and those who sat with them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and when they were removed thence they spake one with another, and said, Nothing that is worthy of death or of bonds hath this man done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agripos said to Festos, This man could have been dismissed, if he had not called the appeal of Caesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And Festos commanded concerning him that he should be sent unto Caesar in Italia. And he delivered Paulos, and other prisoners with him, to a certain man, a centurion of the band of Sebaste, whose name was Julios.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And when he would proceed, we went down to a ship which was from Adramantos the city, to go to the region of Asia. And Aristarkos, a Makedonoya who was of Thessalunike the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>entered the ship with us. And the day after we came to Tsaidon. And the centurion behaved with kindness towards Paulos, and permitted him to go to his friends and be refreshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And from thence we voyaged; and because the winds were contrary we made a circuit unto Cypros.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And we went through the sea of Cilicia and of Pamphulia, and came to Mura, a city of Lukia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And the centurion found there a ship from Aleksandria which was going to Italia, and he placed us in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And because she sailed heavily, (after) many days we had scarce come over against Knidos the island, and as the wind did not permit us to go directly, we went round by Kreta against Salmona the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and hardly voyaging we passing around it came to the place which is called the Fair Havens. AND it was nigh to the city named Lasia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And we were there much time, until the day when the day of the fast of the Jihudoyee had also passed, and there had become danger for one to voyage by sea. And Paulos counselled them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>and said, Men, I perceive that with distress and much loss we are to voyage, not only to the burden of the ship, but also to our own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion hearkened to the governor and to the lord of the ship rather than to the counsel of Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And because that haven was not convenient to winter in, many of us desired to proceed thence, and if possible to come and winter in a certain harbour in Kreta, called Phoniks, and which looked to the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when the wind of the south blew, and we thought we could come as we desired, we sailed round Kreta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>And after a little there came forth against us a blowing of the tempest which is called Tuphonikos Euroklidon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>and the ship was carried away, and could not stand against the wind, and we gave her into its hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And when we had passed a certain isle that is called Cyra; we could scarcely take up the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>And when we had uplifted her, we girded and strengthened the ship. And because we feared lest we should fall into the precipitancy of the sea, we brought down the sails, and so went forward.i</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And while there rose against us the hard tempest, the next day we threw the goods into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day the things of the ship itself we cast forth. And when the storm had held more days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>and neither the sun was seen, nor the moon, nor stars, the hope that we should be saved at all was cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And while no man had taken any food, then stood Paulos among them, and said, Men, if you had been persuaded by me, you would not have voyaged from Kreta, and we should have been exempted from loss, and from this distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Yet now I counsel you to be without anxiety; for not one of you will perish, but the ship only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For in this night there appeared to me the angel of Aloha, (of) him whose I am, and whom I serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>And he said to me, Fear not, Paulos, for thou art to stand before Caesar; and, behold, Aloha hath given thee the gift of all who voyage with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore, men, take courage; for I believe Aloha, that so it shall be as he hath told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>Nevertheless, upon a certain island we have to be cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>AND after fourteen days (in) which we had wandered and been beaten in the sea of Hadrios, in the dividing of the night, the mariners thought that we drew nigh to land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And they cast the lead, and found twenty cubits; and again a little they proceeded, and found fifteen cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing lest we should be found in a place in which were rocks, they cast forth from the hinder part of the ship four anchors, and prayed that it would become day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But the mariners sought to escape from the ship, and lowered from her the boat into the sea, on the pretext that they would go in her, and bind the ship to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>And when Paulos saw, he said to the centurion and to the soldiers, If these in the ship remain not, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then cut the soldiers the cable of the boat from the ship, and let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>But Paulos himself, until it was morning, persuaded all of them to take food, saying to them, To-day it is fourteen days (in which) from danger you have tasted nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Wherefore I beseech you receive meat for the establishment of your lives; for a hair of the head of one of you will not perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And when these he had said, he took bread, and praised Aloha before them all, and he broke and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And they were all comforted, and received food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>But we were in the ship two hundred and seventy and six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, and took up the wheat and sent it into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day, the sailors knew not what land it was; but they saw along the coast a certain inlet of the sea, (into) which they purposed if possible to drive the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And they cut the anchors from the ship, and left them in the sea, and they loosed the bands of the oars, and raised a small sail to the wind which blew, and went forward to the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>And the ship struck on a high place between two depths of the sea, and infixed herself in it; and her forepart stood upon it, and was immovable, but her afterpart was loosed from the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the soldiers would have killed the prisoners, lest they should cast forth to swim, and escape from them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>and the centurion restrained them from this, because he was willing to save Paulos. And those who could cast forth to swim he commanded to be the first to swim, and to pass to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>And the rest, on boards, and on other timbers of the ship, passed; and thus all of them escaped to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>AND afterwards we learned that Melita was called that island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the Barbaroyee who dwelt in it many kindnesses showed us. And they kindled a fire, and called all of us to warm, because there was great rain and cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And Paulos took many sticks and placed upon the fire; and there came forth a viper from the heat of the fire, and bit (him) in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the Barbaroyee saw it hang upon his hand, they said, Perhaps this man is a murderer, whom, though he is escaped from the sea, justice suffereth not to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But Paulos shook his hand, and cast the viper into the fire, and nothing of evil befell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But the Barbaroyee expected that he would immediately have swelled and fallen dead upon the ground; and when they had for a great while expected and saw that nothing of evil befell him, they changed their words, and said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>But there were possessions in that place (belonging) to a certain man whose name was Publios, who himself was the chief of the island; and he cheerfully received us into his house three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>But the father of Publios was ill in a fever, and a disease of the bowels. And Paulos went in to him, and prayed and laid his hand on him, and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>And when this was done, the rest also of them who were diseased in the island came to him and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>And with great honours they honoured us; and when we went forth from thence they supplied us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>But we went forth after three months and voyaged in an Alexandrine ship which had wintered at the island; and she had upon her the sign of the Twins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And we came to Sarakosa the city, and remained there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>And from thence we went round and came to Regium the city. And after one day the south wind blew, and in two days we came to Putialos, a city of Italia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>And we found there brethren, and they prayed of us, and we were with them seven days, and then went we unto Ruma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And when the brethren who were there heard, they came forth to meet us unto the street that is called Apios Foros, and unto the Three Taverns. And when Paulos saw them he thanked Aloha, and was strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And we entered Ruma. And the centurion allowed Paulos to sojourn where he willed, with the soldier, him who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And after three days Paulos sent to convoke the principal men of the Jihudoyee; and when they were assembled, he said to them, Men, brethren, I, who in nothing have risen against the people, nor the law of our fathers, in bonds was delivered from Urishlem into the hands of the Rumoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>And they who examined me willed to dismiss me, because they found not in me any fault worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>And when the Jihudoyee had risen against me, I was constrained to call the appeal of Caesar; (yet) not as though I had in any thing to be the accuser of the sons of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>Wherefore I have besought you to come, that I might see you, and declare to you these things; for on account of the hope of Israel am I bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him, We have not received letters concerning thee from Jihud, and none of the brethren who have come from Urishlem have spoken any thing evil of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we are willing to hear from thee what it is that thou thinkest; for we know that this doctrine is by no man received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>AND they appointed him a day; and many assembled and came where he sojourned; and he explained to them concerning the kingdom of Aloha, testifying and persuading them concerning Jeshu, from the law of Musha and from the prophets, from the morning until the evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some of them were persuaded by his words, and others were not persuaded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And they removed from him, while not agreeing together. And Paulos said to them this word, Well spake the Spirit of Holiness, by the mouth of Eshaia the prophet, against your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, Go unto this people, and say unto them, Hearing, you will hear and will not understand. And you will see, but not discern:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For stupified is the heart of this people, And their hearing they have made heavy, And their eyes have they closed, Lest they should see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their hearts, And be turned unto me, and I should forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be this therefore known to you, that to the Gentiles is sent this redemption, for they will also hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And Paulos hired his own house, and was in it two years, and received there all those who came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>And he preached concerning the kingdom of Aloha, and taught with confidence concerning our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, none forbidding.</verse>
