  <div osisID='2Thess' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you{+} and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are bound to give thanks to God always for you{+}, brothers, even as it is meet, for that your{+} faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of all you{+} toward one another abounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves glory in you{+} in the churches of God for your{+} patience and faith in all your{+} persecutions and in the afflictions which you{+} endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>[which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that you{+} may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you{+} also suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>since it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to those who afflict you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to you{+} who are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>rendering vengeance to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>who will pay a penalty of eternal destruction away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he will come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all those who believed (because our testimony to you{+} was believed) in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>To which end we also pray always for you{+}, that our God may count you{+} worthy of your{+} calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and [every] work of faith, with power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you{+}, and you{+} in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we urge you{+}, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>to the end that you{+} are not quickly shaken from your{+} mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>let no man beguile you{+} in any wise: for [it will not be,] except the falling away comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Don't you{+} remember, that, when I was yet with you{+}, I told you{+} these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now you{+} know that which restrains, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness does already work: only [there is] one who restrains now, until he is removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then will be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his coming;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>[even he], whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And for this cause God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that all who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness, would be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you{+}, brothers beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you{+} from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>to which he also called you{+} through our good news, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So then, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you{+} were taught, whether by word, or by letter of ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort your{+} hearts and establish them in every good work and word.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also [it is] with you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all do not have faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you{+}, and guard you{+} from the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you{+}, that you{+} both do and will do the things which we command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>And may the Lord direct your{+} hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we command you{+}, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you{+} withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you{+} yourselves know how you{+} ought to imitate us: for we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>neither did we eat bread for nothing at any man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>not because we don't have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you{+}, that you{+} should imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you{+}, this we commanded you{+}, If any will not work, neither let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear of some that walk among you{+} disorderly, that don't work at all, but are busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now those who are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness, and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But you{+}, brothers, don't be weary in well-doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And if any man does not obey our word by this letter, note that man, that you{+} do not associate with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>And [yet] do not count as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you{+} peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with all of you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation of me Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you{+}.</verse>
