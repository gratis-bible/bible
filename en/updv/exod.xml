      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And Joseph was in Egypt. And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy-five souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said to his people, Look, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply, and it will come to pass, that, when war breaks out, they will also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and get up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>Therefore they set over them slave masters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with rigor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in bricks, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, in which they made them serve with rigor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>and he said, When you{+} do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth-stool; if it is a son, then you{+} will kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and didn't do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have you{+} done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwife comes to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son who is born you{+} will cast into the river, and every daughter you{+} will save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took as wife the daughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman became pregnant, and gave birth to a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child in it, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And his sister stood far off, to know what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the riverside; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her female slave to fetch it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And she opened it, and saw the child: and, look, the baby wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the young woman went and called the child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And he went out the second day, and, look, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him who did the wrong, Why do you strike your fellow man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made you as a man, a prince and a judge over us? Do you think to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and he settled in the land of Midian after having moved to the land of Midian. And [one day] he sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you{+} have come so soon today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that you{+} have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore a son, and he named him Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the slavery, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and noticed that the bush burned with fire, and the bush wasn't consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And when Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said, Don't come any closer: take off your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And Yahweh said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>And now, look, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me: moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you{+} will serve God on this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said to God, Look, when I come to the sons of Israel, and will say to them, The God of your{+} fathers has sent me to you{+}; and they will say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said to Moses, I AM WHO ALWAYS IS: and he said, Thus you will say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said moreover to Moses, Thus you will say to the sons of Israel, Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you{+}: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you{+}, and [seen] that which is done to you{+} in Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>and I have said, I will bring you{+} up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they will listen to your voice: and you will come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you{+} will say to him, Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us: and now let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you{+} leave to go, not even with a mighty hand [of God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And I will put forth my hand, and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it: and after that he will let you{+} go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it will come to pass, that, when you{+} go, you{+} will not go empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman will ask of her neighbor, and of her who sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and you{+} will put them on your{+} sons, and on your{+} daughters; and you{+} will despoil the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, But, look, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, Yahweh has not appeared to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And Yahweh said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And Yahweh said to Moses, Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And Yahweh said furthermore to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, look, his hand was leprous, as [white as] snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he said, Put your hand into your bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, look, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it will come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And it will come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you will take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said to Yahweh, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before, nor since you have spoken to your slave; for I am slow of mouth, and slow of tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And Yahweh said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes [man] mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you will speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, look, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And you will speak to him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you{+} what you{+} will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>And he will be your spokesman to the people; and it will come to pass, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And you will take in your hand this rod, with which you will do the signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray you, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And Yahweh said to Moses, When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And you will say to Pharaoh, Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my son, my firstborn:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>and I have said to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and you have refused to let him go: look, I will slay your son, your firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Yahweh met him, and sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood you are to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood [you are], because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And Yahweh said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>and Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed: and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the sons of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>And Pharaoh said, Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don't know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, or else he will fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you{+}, Moses and Aaron, take the people away from their works? You{+} get to your{+} burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Look, the people of the land are now many, and you{+} make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>You{+} will no more give the people straw to make bricks, as before: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And the number of the bricks, which they made before, you{+} will lay on them; you{+} will not diminish anything of it: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor at it; and don't let them regard lying words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you{+} straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go yourselves, you{+} get straw where you{+} can find it: for nothing of your{+} work will be diminished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your{+} works, [your{+}] daily tasks, as when there was straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have you{+} not fulfilled your{+} task both yesterday and today, in making bricks as before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal thus with your slaves?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.14.25'>And he locked their chariot wheels, and they were hard to drive; so the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.14.26'>And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.14.27'>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.14.28'>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of the whole host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.14.29'>But the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.14.30'>Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.14.31'>And Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did on the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh: and they believed in Yahweh, and in his slave Moses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.21.8'>If she doesn't please her master, who has espoused her to himself, then he will let her be redeemed: to sell her to a foreign people he will have no power, seeing he has betrayed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.21.9'>And if he espouses her to his son, he will deal with her after the manner of daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.21.10'>If he takes him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, he will not diminish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.21.11'>And if he does not do these three things to her, then she will go out for nothing, without money.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.21.29'>But if the ox was in the habit to gore in time past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the ox will be stoned, and its owner also will be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.21.30'>If there be laid on him a ransom, then he will give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.21.32'>If the ox gores a male slave or a female slave, there will be given to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox will be stoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.21.33'>And if a man will open a pit, or if a man will dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall in it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.21.36'>Or if it is known that the ox was in the habit to gore in time past, and its owner has not kept it in, he will surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] will be his own.</verse>
