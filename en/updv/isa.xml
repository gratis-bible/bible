      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Yahweh has spoken: I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib; [but] Israel does not know, my people do not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Yahweh, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why will you{+} be still stricken, that you{+} revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they haven't been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your{+} country is desolate; your{+} cities are burned with fire; your{+} land, strangers devour it in your{+} presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except Yahweh of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you{+} people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>What to me is the multitude of your{+} sacrifices? says Yahweh: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When you{+} come to see my face, who has required this at your{+} hand, to trample my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is disgusting to me; new moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies--I can't endure evil and the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your{+} new moons and your{+} appointed feasts my soul hates; they are a trouble to me; I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when you{+} spread forth your{+} hands, I will hide my eyes from you{+}; yes, when you{+} make many prayers, I will not hear: your{+} hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your{+} doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>learn to do well; seek justice, correct oppression, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, says Yahweh: though your{+} sins be as scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they will be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If you{+} are willing and obedient, you{+} will eat the good of the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>but if you{+} refuse and rebel, you{+} will be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How has the faithful city become a prostitute! She that was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your princes are rebellious, and partners of thieves; everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards: they do not judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>and I will turn my hand on you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all your tin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>and I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning: afterward you will be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion will be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners will be together, and those who forsake Yahweh will be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they will be ashamed of the oaks which you{+} have desired, and you{+} will be confounded for the gardens that you{+} have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For you{+} will be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong will be as flax, and his work as a spark; and they will both burn together, and none will quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it will come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's house will be established on the top of the mountains, and will be exalted above the hills; and all nations will flow to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many peoples will go and say, Come{+}, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come{+}, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with customs] from the east, and [are] omen interpreters like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And man is bowed down, and a man is brought low: therefore don't forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man will be brought low, and the haughtiness of men will be bowed down, and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For there will be a day of Yahweh of hosts on all that is proud and haughty, and on all that is lifted up; and it will be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>and on all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and on all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>and on all the high mountains, and on all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>and on every lofty tower, and on every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all pleasant imagery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man will be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men will be brought low; and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols will completely pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And men will go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to mightily shake the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day man will cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to mightily shake the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease yourselves from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for what is he to be accounted of?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, look, the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and means of support, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the fortune-teller, and the elder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the expert artificer, and the expert charmer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes will rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people will be oppressed, man against man, and a man by his fellow man: the child will behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], You have clothing, be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>in that day he will lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: you{+} will not make me ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The expression of their face witnesses against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have done evil to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say{+} of the righteous, that [it will be] well [with him]; for they will eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked! [It will be] ill [with him]; for what his hands have done will be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and usurers rule over them. O my people, those who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and its princes: It is you{+} who have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your{+} houses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>what do you{+} mean that you{+} crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover Yahweh said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the top of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Yahweh will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings, and the nose-jewels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it will come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there will be rottenness; and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men will fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates will lament and mourn; and she will sit on the ground emptied.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day the branch of Yahweh will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be excellent and comely for those who have escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it will come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, will be called holy, even everyone who is written to life in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and will have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory [will be spread] a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>and he dug it, and gathered out its stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a wine press in it: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you{+}, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What more could have been done to my vineyard, that I haven't done in it? Why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, did it bring forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will tell you{+} what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up; I will break down its wall, and it will be trodden down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>and I will lay it waste; it will not be pruned nor hoed; but there will come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, look, oppression; for righteousness, but, look, a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe to those who join house to house, that lay field to field, until there is no room, and you{+} are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>Yahweh of hosts [revealed] in my ears, Of a truth many houses will be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard will yield one bath, and a homer of seed will yield [but] an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, until wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Yahweh, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend [into it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And man is bowed down, and a man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>but Yahweh of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then the lambs will be shepherded as in their pasture, and wanderers will eat the waste places of the fat ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>that say, Let him make speed, let him hurry his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom will go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of Yahweh kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has struck them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, look, they will come with speed swiftly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None will be weary nor stumble among them; none will slumber nor sleep; neither will the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the strap of their sandals be broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs will be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>their roaring will be like a lioness, they will roar like young lions; yes, they will roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there will be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And they will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one looks to the land, look, darkness [and] distress; and the light is darkened in its clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then I said, Woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live charcoal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Look, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.36.1'>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.36.2'>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.37.1'>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.37.4'>It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard: therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant who is left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.5'>So the slaves of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.6'>And Isaiah said to them, Thus you{+} will say to your{+} master, Thus says Yahweh, Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the attendants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.37.8'>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.9'>And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come out to fight against you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.37.14'>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.15'>And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.16'>O Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, who sits [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.17'>Incline your ear, O Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, O Yahweh, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.18'>Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.19'>and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of man's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.37.21'>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.22'>this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.37.25'>I have dug and drank water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.26'>Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.27'>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, which is blighted before the east wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.28'>But I know your rising up and your sitting down, and your going out and your coming in, and your raging against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.29'>Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.30'>And this will be the sign to you: you{+} will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow{+}, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.31'>And the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.32'>For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who will escape. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will perform this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.33'>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.34'>By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.35'>For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my slave David's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.36'>And the angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000; and when men arose early in the morning, look, these were all dead bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.37'>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.37.38'>And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.53.1'>Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.2'>For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor majesty; and when we see him, there is no appearance that we should desire him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.3'>He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we did not esteem him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.4'>Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck of God, and afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.5'>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.6'>All of us like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.7'>He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute, so he didn't open his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.8'>By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and who considered his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; because of the transgression of my people he was stricken to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.9'>And they made his grave with the wicked, and his tomb with the rich; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.10'>Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him who was made sick. If his soul makes an offering for sin, [then] he will see [his] seed, he will prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh will prosper in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.11'>He will see the light of the travail of his soul, [and] will be satisfied: by his knowledge will my righteous slave justify many; and he will bear their iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.12'>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he will divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for their sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.61.1'>The Spirit of the Sovereign Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening [of the prison] to those who are bound;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is in it: so I will do for my slaves' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen will inherit it, and my slaves will stay there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, my slaves will eat, but you{+} will be hungry; look, my slaves will drink, but you{+} will be thirsty; look, my slaves will rejoice, but you{+} will be put to shame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>look, my slaves will sing for joy of heart, but you{+} will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for vexation of spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He who kills an ox is as he who slays a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an oblation, [as he who offers] swine's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their detestable things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none answered; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} who tremble at his word: Your{+} brothers who hate you{+}, who cast you{+} out for my name's sake, have said, Let Yahweh be glorious, that we may see your{+} joy; but it is those who will be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Yahweh who renders recompense to his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Will a land be born in one day? Will a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus says Yahweh, Look, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you{+} will be nursed and be borne on the side; and will be cuddled on the knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you{+}; and you{+} will be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>And you{+} will see [it], and your{+} heart will rejoice, and your{+} bones will flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Yahweh will be known toward his slaves; and he will have indignation against his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For, look, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the detestable, and the mouse, they will come to an end together, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>As for me, given their works and their thoughts: [the time] comes that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they will come, and will see my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles far off, that haven't heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they will declare my glory among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they will bring all your{+} brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the sons of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And of them I will also take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will remain before me, says Yahweh, so will your{+} seed and your{+} name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it will come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>And they will go forth, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their worm will not die, neither will their fire be quenched; and they will be an abhorring to all flesh.</verse>
