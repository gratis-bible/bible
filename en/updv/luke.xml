  <div osisID='Luke' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and attendants of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were [now] well stricken in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him an angel of Yahweh standing on the right side of altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias was troubled when he saw [him], and fear fell on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Don't be afraid, Zacharias: because your supplication is heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the sons of Israel he will turn to Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient [to walk] in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for Yahweh a people prepared [for him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And look, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will come to pass, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled while he tarried in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs to them, and remained mute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus has Yahweh done to me in the days in which he looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to the wife of a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and her name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And he came in to her, and said, Hail, you who are highly favored, the Lord [is] with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and reasoned within herself what manner of salutation this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Don't be afraid, Mary: for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And look, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High: and Yahweh God will give to him the throne of his father David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel, How will this be? I am not able to have children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore, the holy one who is begotten will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And look, Elizabeth your kinswoman, in her old age, she also has conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For nothing will be impossible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Look, [I am] Yahweh's slave; let it happen to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country in a hurry, into a city of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed [are] you among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And how is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For look, when the voice of your salutation came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed [is] she who believed; for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he has looked on the low [position] of his slave: For look, from now on all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he who is mighty has done to me great things; And holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is to generations and generations On those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with his arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down princes from [their] thrones, And has exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry he has filled with good things; And the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has given help to Israel his son, That he might remember mercy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>(As he spoke to our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elizabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that Yahweh had magnified his mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he will be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is none of your kindred who is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came upon all who dwelt around them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of Yahweh was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed [be] Yahweh, the God of Israel; For he has visited and made redemption for his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his son David</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>(As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To show mercy toward, our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he spoke to Abraham our father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>To grant to us that we being delivered out of the hand of [our] enemies Should serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>Yes and you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High: For you will go before Yahweh to make ready his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to his people In the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Because of the tender mercy of our God, By which the rising sun from on high will visit us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his showing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to enroll themselves, each to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to enroll himself with Mary, his wife, being pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were shepherds in the same country living in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And an angel of Yahweh stood by them, and the glory of Yahweh shone around them: and they were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Don't be afraid; for look, I bring you{+} good news of great joy which will be to all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>for there is born to you{+} this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this [will be] the sign to you{+}: You{+} will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came in a hurry, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of Yahweh, Every male that opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of Yahweh, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And look, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen Yahweh's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now let your slave depart, O Sovereign Yahweh, According to your word, in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light for revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Look, this [child] is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she had been a widow even to eighty-four years), who did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasts and supplications night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of Yahweh, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents didn't know it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, Child, why have you thus dealt with us? Look, your father and I sought you sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, How is it that you{+} sought me? Did you{+} not know that I must be in my Father's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject to them: and his mother kept all [these] sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance to remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the Book of the Words of Isaiah the Prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make{+} ready the way of Yahweh, Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley will be filled, And every mountain and hill will be brought low; And the crooked will become straight, And the rough ways smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh will see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, You{+} offspring of vipers, who warned you{+} to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father: for I say to you{+}, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And he answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him impart to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what must we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, Collect no more than that which is appointed you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said to them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse [anyone] wrongfully; and be content with your{+} wages.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>during forty days, being tried by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>And the devil said to him, if you are the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>And Jesus answered to him, It is written, Man will not live by bread alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the devil said to him, To you I will give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it has been delivered to me; and to whomever I will I give it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>And Jesus answered and said to him, It is written, You will worship Yahweh your God, and you will serve only him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and news went out concerning him through all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And there was delivered to him the Book of the Prophet Isaiah. And he unrolled the book, and found the place where it was written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>The Spirit of Yahweh is on me, Because he anointed me to preach good news to the poor: He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, And recovering of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are bruised,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all bore him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Isn't this Joseph's son?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But of a truth I say to you{+}, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>and to none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he passing through among them went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>Ah! What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the middle [of the synagogue], he came out of him, having done him no hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And amazement came upon all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place around the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's wife's mother was held with a great fever; and they implored him for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>And when the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with diverse diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on each one of them, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God. And rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came to him, and tried to keep him, that he should not go from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them, I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore I was sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he had left speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your{+} nets for a catch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish; and their nets were breaking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>and they beckoned to their sharers in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, look, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and implored him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be made clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he charged him to tell no man: but go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according to as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of Yahweh was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And look, men bring on a bed a man who was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the middle [of everyone] before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And seeing their faith, he said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said to them, Why do you{+} reason in your{+} hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you{+} may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he said to him who was palsied: I say to you, Arise, and take up your couch, and go to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that on which he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>And after these things he went forth, and noticed a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others who were sitting at meat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you{+} eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answering said to them, Those who are in health have no need of a physician; but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the [disciples] of the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And Jesus said to them, Can you{+} make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come; and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he spoke also a parable to them: No man rends a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no man having drank old [wine] desires new; for he says, The old is good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Now it came to pass on a Sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked and ate the ears, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do you{+} do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>And Jesus answering them said, Have you{+} not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave to those who were with him; which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And he said to them, The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>And it came to pass on another Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand in the middle [of the synagogue]. And he arose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>And Jesus said to them, I ask you{+}, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to destroy it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And he looked around on them all, and said to him, Stretch forth your hand. And he did [so]: and his hand was restored.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.42'>How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in your eye, when you yourself don't look at the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote that is in your brother's eye.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who hears [my words], and does not [do them], is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And they, when they came to Jesus, implored him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that you should do this for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the captain sent friends, saying to him, Lord, don't trouble yourself; for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to you: but say the word, and let my [young] slave be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude that followed him, I say to you{+}, I haven't found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the slave whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it came to pass soon afterward, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, look, there was carried out one who was dead, the only begotten son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And he who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us: and, God has visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judea, and all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John told him of all these things. And John calling to him two of his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And when the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who comes, or do we look for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many who were blind he bestowed sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you{+} have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he, whoever will find no occasion of stumbling in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you{+} go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you{+} go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Look, those who are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped to you{+}, and you{+} did not dance; we wailed, and you{+} did not weep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And look, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee that had invited him saw it, he spoke to himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that touches him, that she's a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to you. And he says, Teacher, say on.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint my head with oil: but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass soon afterward, that he went about through cities and villages, proclaiming and preaching [the good news about] the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who were serving them out of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted to him, he spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, To you{+} it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>And those by the wayside are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And those on the rock [are] they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for awhile believe, and in time of trial fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>And no man, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter in may see the light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling [with water], and were in jeopardy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, Where is your{+} faith? And being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when he came forth on the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and did not stay in [any] house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I urge you, don't torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for many demons went into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was there a herd of many swine being shepherded on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when those who shepherded them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons went out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those who saw it told them how he who was possessed with demons was made whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And all the people around the country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were held with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But the man from whom the demons had gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to your house, and declare how much God has done for you. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And look, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and implored him to come into his house;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the chosen one: hear{+} him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it came to pass, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And look, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I urge you to look at my son; for he is my only begotten:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I implored your disciples to cast it out; and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you{+}, and bear with you{+}? Bring your son here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was yet coming, the demon dashed him down, and tore [him] grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a little child, and set him by his side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, Whoever will receive this little child in my name receives me: and whoever will receive me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among all of you{+}, the same is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>And it came to pass, when the days were well-near come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not receive him, because his face was [as though he were] going to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when the disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, do you want us to bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned, and rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And as they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven [have] nests; but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But he said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go you and publish abroad the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, I will follow you, Lord; but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>And he spoke a parable to them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>saying, There was in a city a judge, who didn't fear God, and didn't regard man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>and there was a widow in that city; and she came often to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>And he would not for awhile: but after these things he said to himself, Though I don't fear God, nor regard man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And will not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and [yet] he is long-suffering over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I say to you{+}, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he spoke also this parable to certain ones, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nothing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the publican, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but struck his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I say to you{+}, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; but he who humbles himself will be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>And they were bringing to him also their babies, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to him, saying, Allow the little children to come to me, and don't forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the good news, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and they spoke, saying to him, Tell us: By what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answered and said to them, I also will ask you{+} a question; and tell me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say, Why didn't you{+} believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we will say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered, that they didn't know from where [it was].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you{+} by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he sent yet another slave: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he looked on them, and said, What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spoke this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and do not accept the person [of any], but of a truth teach the way of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give tax to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have? And they said, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And he said to them, Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they were not able to take hold of what he said before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, those denying that there is a resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died childless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>and the second:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Afterward the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for neither can they die anymore: for they are equal to the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in [the place concerning] the bush, when he calls Yahweh the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, you have said well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they didn't dare anymore ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, and beginning from Galilee even to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiers also set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, You{+} brought to me this man, as one who perverts the people: and look, I having examined him before you{+}, found no fault in this man concerning those things of which you{+} accuse him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back to us; and look, he has been participating in nothing worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>And Pilate spoke to them again, desiring to release Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released him who for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And when they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your{+} children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For look, the days are coming, in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there were also two others, criminals, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood watching. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the criminals who were hanged railed on him, saying, Are not you the Christ? Save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Don't you even fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of what we participated in: but this man participated in nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And he said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you will be with me in Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>the sun's light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And when the captain saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood far off, seeing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And look, a man named Joseph, who was a councilor, and a good and righteous man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>--he had not consented to their counsel and activity--[a man] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where man had never yet lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and looked at the tomb, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And they entered in, and didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, look, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>and as they were frightened and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why do you{+} seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you{+} when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the [mother] of James: and the other women with them told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter arose, and ran to the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he sees the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which came to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And look, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What communications are these that you{+} have one with another, as you{+} walk? And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said to him, Do you alone sojourn [in] Jerusalem and not know the things which have come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man [who was] a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yes and besides all these things, this is now the third day since these things came to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they didn't find his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but they didn't see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Didn't it behoove the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking [it] he gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Wasn't our heart burning inside us, while he spoke to us in the way, while he opened to us the Scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they spoke these things, he himself stood among them, and says to them, Peace [be] to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are you{+} troubled? And why do questionings arise in your{+} heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you{+} see me having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you{+} here anything to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took it, and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are my words which I spoke to you{+}, while I was yet with you{+}, that all things must surely be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the Scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and he said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance unto remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You{+} are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And look, I send the promise of my Father on you{+}: but you{+} tarry in the city, until you{+} are clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out until [they were] across from Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</verse>
