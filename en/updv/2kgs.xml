      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you{+} go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus says Yahweh, You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but will surely die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that you{+} have returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king who sent you{+}, and say to him, Thus says Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but will surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you{+}, and told you{+} these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girded with a belt of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and saw that he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spoke to him, O man of God, the king has said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pled to him for mercy, and said to him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty slaves of yours, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Look, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with him: don't be afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but will surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when Yahweh was to take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for Yahweh has sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Beth-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets who were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold your{+} peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold your{+} peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray you; for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And both of them went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood across from them far off: and both of them stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that both of them went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I will do for you, before I am taken from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, You have asked a hard thing: [nevertheless], if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so to you; but if not, it will not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, look, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which separated them both apart; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah, even he? And when he had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho across from him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him, Look now, there are with your slaves fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master, in case the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You{+} will not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said to them, Didn't I say to you{+}, Don't go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Look, we pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt in it, and said, Thus says Yahweh, I have healed these waters; there will not be from there anymore death or miscarrying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there to Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. And there came forth two she-bears out of the forest, and tore forty and two lads of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he stuck to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him? And one of the king of Israel's slaves answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No; for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus says Yahweh, You{+} will not see wind, neither will you{+} see rain; yet that valley will be filled with water, and you{+} will drink, both you{+} and your{+} cattle and your{+} beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh: he will also deliver the Moabites into your{+} hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And you{+} will strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and will fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, look, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water across from them as red as blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each man his fellow man: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went there and struck the Moabites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until they left [only] its stones in Kir-hareseth; nevertheless the slingers went about it, and struck it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too intense for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword, to break through to the king of Syria; but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering on the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your slave my husband is dead; and you know that your slave did fear Yahweh: and the creditor has come to take to him my two children to be slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me; what do you have in the house? And she said, Your slave doesn't have anything in the house, but a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, Go, borrow for yourself vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; don't borrow a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And you will go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you will set aside that which is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and you and your sons live from the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Look now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make, I pray you, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand: and it will be, when he comes to us, that he will turn in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his attendant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Look, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? Would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no son, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, At this season, when the time comes round, you will embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman became pregnant, and gave birth to a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to his attendant, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the attendants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath. And she said, It will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her attendant, Drive, and go forward; don't slow down the riding for me, except I bid you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her far off, that he said to Gehazi his attendant, Look, yonder is the Shunammite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>run, I pray you, now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed inside her; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Don't deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, don't greet him; and if any greets you, don't answer him again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child did not awaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha came into the house, look, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>He went in therefore, and shut the door on both of them, and prayed to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up your son.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.1'>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.2'>And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.3'>And she said to her mistress, Oh that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would recover him of his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.4'>And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.5'>And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.6'>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter has come to you, look, I have sent Naaman my slave to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.7'>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? But consider, I pray you{+}, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.8'>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.9'>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.10'>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will come again to you, and you will be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.11'>But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Look, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.12'>Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.13'>And his slaves came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.14'>Then he went down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.15'>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Look now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a present of your slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.16'>But he said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.17'>And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray you, let there be given to your slave two mules' burden of earth; for your slave will from now on offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.18'>In this thing Yahweh pardon your slave: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh pardon your slave in this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.19'>And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.20'>But Gehazi the attendant of Elisha the man of God, said, Look, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.21'>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he dismounted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.22'>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Look, even now there have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.23'>And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them on two of his attendants; and they bore them before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.24'>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.25'>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where did you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your slave went no where.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.26'>And he said to him, Didn't my heart go [with you], when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and male slaves and female slaves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.27'>The leprosy therefore of Naaman will stick to you, and to your seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.11'>and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.12'>and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, You{+} will not do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.13'>Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn{+} from your{+} evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your{+} fathers, and which I sent to you{+} by my slaves the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.14'>Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn't believe in Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.15'>And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and [went] after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Yahweh had charged them that they should not act like them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.16'>And they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made themselves molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.17'>And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and told the future and used magic, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.18'>Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.19'>Also Judah did not keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.20'>And Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.21'>For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.22'>And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.25'>And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn't fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.26'>Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don't know the law of the god of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, look, they slay them, because they don't know the law of the god of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.27'>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you{+} brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.28'>So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.29'>Nevertheless every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.30'>And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.34'>To this day they do after the former manner: they don't fear Yahweh, neither do they act after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Yahweh commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.35'>with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You{+} will not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.17.41'>So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their graven images; their sons likewise, and the sons of their sons, as did their fathers, so they do to this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.9'>And he burnt the house of Yahweh, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burnt with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.10'>And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were [with] the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.11'>And the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.12'>But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.13'>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze of them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.14'>And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered, they took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.15'>And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.16'>The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.17'>The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of bronze: and like these had the second pillar with network.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.18'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.19'>and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, who were found in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.20'>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.21'>And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.22'>And as for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.23'>Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.24'>And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, Don't be afraid because of the slaves of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.25'>But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.26'>And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.27'>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.28'>and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.29'>and changed his prison garments. And [Jehoiachin] ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.30'>and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given to him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.</verse>
