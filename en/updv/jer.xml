      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then I said, Ah, Sovereign Yahweh! Look, I don't know how to speak; for I am a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But Yahweh said to me, Don't say, I am a child; for to whomever I will send you you will go, and whatever I will command you you will speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, Look, I have put my words in your mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>see, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then Yahweh said to me, You have well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling cauldron; and the face of it is from the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then Yahweh said to me, Out of the north evil will break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, look, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Yahweh; and they will come, and they will set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you: don't be dismayed at them, or else I will dismay you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, look, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they will fight against you; but they will not prevail against you: for I am with you, says Yahweh, to deliver you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel [was] holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase: all who devour him will be held guilty; evil will come upon them, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear{+} the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have your{+} fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Neither did they say, Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that a man has not passed through, and where man has not dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you{+} into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you{+} entered, you{+} defiled my land, and made my heritage disgusting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests didn't say, Where is Yahweh? And those who handle the law didn't know me: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore I will yet contend with you{+}, says Yahweh, and with the sons of your{+} sons I will contend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation exchanged [its] gods, which yet are no gods? But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, O you{+} heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be{+} very desolate, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a slave? Is he a home-born [slave]? Why has he become a prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>The sons also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the top of your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Have you not procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Your own wickedness will correct you, and your backslidings will reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, I will not serve; for on every high hill and under every green tree you were laying down prostituting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then have you turned into the wild branches of a foreign vine to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though you wash yourself with lye, and take yourself much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How can you say, I am not defiled, I haven't gone after the Baalim? See your way in the valley, know what you have done: [you are] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>who say to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where are your gods that you have made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Why will you{+} contend with me? All of you{+} have transgressed against me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain I have struck your{+} sons; they received no correction: your{+} own sword has devoured your{+} prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, see{+} the word of Yahweh. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, We have broken loose; we will come no more to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>How you trim your way to seek love! Therefore even the wicked women you have taught your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger has turned away from me. Look, I will enter into judgment with you, because you say, I haven't sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why do you want to go away so much to change your course? You will be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>From there also you will go forth, with your hands on your head: for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>They say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes another man's, will he return to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But you have prostituted with many companions; yet return again to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where haven't you been lain with? By the ways you have sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Will you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are the best friend of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he retain [his anger] forever? Will he keep it to the end? Look, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She's gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree and prostituted there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me; but she didn't return: and her betraying sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet betraying Judah her sister didn't fear; but she also went and prostituted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it came to pass through the lightness of her prostitution, that she defiled herself together with the land, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet for all this her betraying sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than betraying Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I will not look in anger on you{+}; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not keep [anger] forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you{+} haven't obeyed my voice, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, O backsliding sons, says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you{+}: and I will take you{+} one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you{+} to Zion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>and I will give you{+} shepherds according to my heart, who will shepherd you{+} with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it will come to pass, when you{+} have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says Yahweh, they will say no more, The ark of the covenant of Yahweh; neither will it come to mind; neither will they remember it; neither will they miss it; neither will it be made anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh; and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem: neither will they walk anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your{+} fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said, How I will put you among the sons, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! And I said, You will call me My Father, and will not turn away from following me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely as a wife betrays [by divorcing] from her companion, so you{+} have betrayed me, O house of Israel, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping [and] the supplications of the sons of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, you{+} backsliding sons, I will heal your{+} backslidings. Look, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly, delusion comes from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: [but] truly in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day; and we haven't obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If you will return, O Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me, and if you will put away your detestable things out of my sight; then you will not be removed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>and you will swear, As Yahweh lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations will bless themselves in him, and in him they will glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your{+} fallow ground, and don't sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your{+} heart, you{+} men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; or else my wrath will go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your{+} doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare{+} in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow{+} the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, don't stop; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he has gone forth from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this gird yourselves with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh has not turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it will come to pass at that day, says Yahweh, that the heart of the king will perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests will be astonished, and the prophets will wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then I said, Ah, Sovereign Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You{+} will have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>a full wind from these will come for me: now I will also utter judgments against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Look, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots [will be] as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge inside you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>make mention to the nations; Look, publish against Jerusalem [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As keepers of a field are those against her round about, because she has been rebellious against me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Your way and your doings have procured these things to you; this is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>Inside me, inside me! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly my tents are destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For my people are foolish; they don't know me. They are foolish sons, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil; but to do good they don't know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I saw the earth, and, look, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I saw the mountains, and, look, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I looked and saw that man was not there, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I looked and saw that the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, [and] before his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus says Yahweh, The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they come into holes, hide in thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And you, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you dress yourself with scarlet, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain you make yourself fair; [your] lovers despise you, they seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run{+} to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if you{+} can find a man, if there is any who does justly, who seeks truth; and I will pardon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And if they say, As Yahweh lives; surely they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O Yahweh, don't your eyes look at truth? You have stricken them, but they were not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they don't know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will get myself to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.3'>For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and don't speak: they must surely be borne, because they can't go. Don't be afraid of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>Thus you{+} will say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he has stretched out the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>For the shepherds have become brutish, and haven't inquired of Yahweh: therefore they haven't prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>The voice of news, look, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.11.5'>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your{+} fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then I answered, and said, Amen, O Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.6'>And Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear{+} the words of this covenant, and do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.7'>For I earnestly protested to your{+} fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.11.8'>Yet they didn't obey, nor incline their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn't do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.13.11'>For as the belt sticks to the loins of a man, so I have caused to stick to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says Yahweh; that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.13.12'>Therefore you will speak to them this word: This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Every bottle will be filled with wine: and they will say to you, Don't we certainly know that every bottle will be filled with wine?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.26.2'>Thus says Yahweh: Stand in the court of Yahweh's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh's house, all the words that I command you to speak to them; do not diminish a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.3'>It may be they will listen, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.4'>And you will say to them, Thus says Yahweh: If you{+} will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.5'>to listen to the words of my slaves the prophets, whom I send to you{+}, even rising up early and sending them, but you{+} haven't listened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.6'>then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.7'>And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.8'>And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, You will surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.9'>Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people had gathered to Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.10'>And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of Yahweh; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's [house].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.11'>Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he has prophesied against this city, as you{+} have heard with your{+} ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.12'>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you{+} have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.13'>Now therefore amend your{+} ways and your{+} doings, and obey the voice of Yahweh your{+} God; and Yahweh will repent of the evil that he has pronounced against you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.14'>But as for me, look, I am in your{+} hand: do with me as is good and right in your{+} eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.15'>Only know{+} for certain that, if you{+} put me to death, you{+} will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on its inhabitants; for of a truth Yahweh has sent me to you{+} to speak all these words in your{+} ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.16'>Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.17'>Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.18'>Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Zion will be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem will become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.19'>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus we are committing great evil against our own souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.20'>And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Yahweh, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.21'>and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty-men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.22'>and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [namely], Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.23'>and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.24'>But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.27.1'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.2'>This is what Yahweh said to me: Make bonds and bars for yourself, and put them on your neck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.3'>and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.4'>and give them a charge to their masters, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus you{+} will say to your{+} masters:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.5'>I have made the earth, and man and beast that are on the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it to whom it seems right to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.6'>And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my slave; and the beasts of the field also I have given him to serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.7'>And all the nations will serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his own land comes: and then many nations and great kings will make him their slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.8'>And it will come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish, says Yahweh, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.9'>But as for you{+}, don't listen to your{+} prophets, or to your{+} fortune-tellers, or to your{+} dreamers, or to your{+} psychics, or to your{+} sorcerers, that speak to you{+}, saying, You{+} will not serve the king of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.10'>for they prophesy a lie to you{+}, to remove you{+} far from your{+} land, and that I should drive you{+} out, and you{+} should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.11'>But the nation that will bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that [nation] I will let remain in their own land, says Yahweh; and they will till it, and dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.12'>And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your{+} necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.13'>Why will you{+} die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.14'>And don't listen to the words of the prophets that speak to you{+}, saying, You{+} will not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.15'>For I haven't sent them, says Yahweh, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you{+} out, and that you{+} may perish, you{+}, and the prophets that prophesy to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.16'>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Don't listen to the words of your{+} prophets that prophesy to you{+}, saying, Look, the vessels of Yahweh's house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.17'>Don't listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: why should this city become a desolation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.18'>But if they are prophets, and if the word of Yahweh is with them, let them now make intercession to Yahweh of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don't go to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.19'>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.20'>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.21'>yes, thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.27.22'>They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them, says Yahweh; then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.28'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Yahweh, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.2'>Thus speaks Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.3'>Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.4'>and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.5'>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.6'>even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: May Yahweh do so; May Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh's house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.7'>Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.8'>The prophets that have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.9'>The prophet that prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet will come to pass, then will the prophet be known, that Yahweh has truly sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.10'>Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.11'>And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.12'>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.13'>Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh: You have broken the bars of wood; but you have made in their stead bars of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.14'>For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.15'>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.16'>Therefore thus says Yahweh, Look, I will send you away from off the face of the earth: this year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.28.17'>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.29'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.1'>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.2'>(after Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, [and] the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the blacksmiths, had departed from Jerusalem,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.3'>by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,) saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.4'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.5'>Build{+} houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.6'>Take{+} wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your{+} sons, and give your{+} daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply{+} there, and don't be diminished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.7'>And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you{+} to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you{+} will have peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.8'>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says, the God of Israel: Don't let your{+} prophets who are in the midst of you{+}, and your{+} fortune-tellers, deceive you{+}; neither listen{+} to your{+} dreamers whom you{+} get to dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.9'>For they prophesy falsely to you{+} in my name: I haven't sent them, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.10'>For thus says Yahweh, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you{+}, and perform my good word toward you{+}, in causing you{+} to return to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.11'>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you{+}, says Yahweh, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you{+} hope in your{+} latter end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.12'>And you{+} will call on me, and you{+} will go and pray to me, and I will listen to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.13'>And you{+} will seek me, and find me, when you{+} will search for me with all your{+} heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.14'>And I will be found of you{+}, says Yahweh, and I will turn again your{+} captivity, and I will gather you{+} from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you{+}, says Yahweh; and I will bring you{+} again to the place from where I caused you{+} to be carried away captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.15'>Because you{+} have said, Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.16'>thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your{+} brothers who have not gone forth with you{+} into captivity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.17'>this is what Yahweh of Hosts says; Look, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that can't be eaten, they are so bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.18'>And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.19'>because they haven't listened to my words, says Yahweh, with which I sent to them my slaves the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you{+} would not hear, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.20'>Hear{+} therefore the word of Yahweh, all you{+} of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.21'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you{+} in my name: Look, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he will slay them before your{+} eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.22'>and of them will be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.23'>because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their fellow men's wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I did not command them; and I am he who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.24'>And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you will speak, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.25'>Thus speaks Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.26'>Yahweh has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh, for every man who is insane, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.27'>Now therefore, why haven't you rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you{+},</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.28'>since he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, [The captivity] is long: build{+} houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.29'>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.30'>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.31'>Send to all those of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you{+}, and I did not send him, and he has caused you{+} to trust in a lie;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.29.32'>therefore thus says Yahweh, Look, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he will not have a man to dwell among this people, neither will he see the good that I will do to my people, says Yahweh, because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.30'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.2'>Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.3'>For, look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.4'>And these are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.5'>For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.6'>Ask{+} now, and see whether a man travails with child: why do I see every [able-bodied] man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces have turned pale?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.7'>Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he will be saved out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.8'>And it will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers will no more make him their slave;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.30.11'>For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.30.13'>There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.14'>All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins have increased.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.30.16'>Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; and those who despoil you will be a spoil, and all who prey on you I will give for a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.30.17'>For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.31.7'>For thus says Yahweh, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish{+}, praise{+}, and say, O Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.8'>Look, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, [and] with them the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and her who travails with child together: a great company they will return here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.9'>They will come with weeping; and with supplications I will lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they will not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.10'>Hear the word of Yahweh, O you{+} nations, and declare it in the isles far off; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.11'>For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.12'>And they will come and sing in the height of Zion, and will flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the sons of the flock and of the herd: and their soul will be as a watered garden; and they will not sorrow anymore at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.13'>Then will the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.14'>And I will soak the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people will be satisfied with my goodness, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.15'>Thus says Yahweh: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her sons; she refuses to be comforted for her sons, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.16'>Thus says Yahweh: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work will be rewarded, says Yahweh; and they will come again from the land of the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.17'>And there is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and [your] sons will come again to their own border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.18'>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus], You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed [to the yoke]: turn me, and I will be turned; for you are Yahweh my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.19'>Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I struck on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.20'>Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I earnestly remember him still: therefore my insides yearn for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.21'>Set up waymarks, make guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these cities of yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.22'>How long will you go here and there, O you backsliding daughter? For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth: a woman will encircle an [able-bodied] man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.23'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I will bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless you, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.24'>And Judah and all its cities will dwell in it together, the husbandmen, and [those who] go about with flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.25'>For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul I have replenished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.26'>On this I awakened, and looked; and my sleep was sweet to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.27'>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.28'>And it will come to pass that, like I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.29'>In those days they will say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.30'>But every one will die for his own iniquity: any among man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.31'>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.32'>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.33'>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they will be my people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.34'>and they will teach no more every man his fellow man, and every man his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.35'>Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; Yahweh of hosts is his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.36'>If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.37'>Thus says Yahweh: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.38'>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city will be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.39'>And the measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn about to Goah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.31.40'>And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, will be holy to Yahweh; it will not be plucked up, nor thrown down anymore forever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.32'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will look at his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he will be until I visit him, says Yahweh: though you{+} fight with the Chaldeans, you{+} will not prosper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>And Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>Look, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.8'>So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, [containing] the terms and the stipulations, and that which was open:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.14'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.15'>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.16'>Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.17'>Ah Sovereign Yahweh! Look, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.18'>who show loving-kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of hosts is his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.19'>great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of man, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.20'>who did set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among man; and made you a name, as at this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.21'>and did bring forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.22'>and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.23'>and they came in, and possessed it, but they did not obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Look, the mounds, they have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has come to pass; and, look, you see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>And you have said to me, O Sovereign Yahweh, Buy the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.27'>Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.28'>Therefore thus says Yahweh: Look, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.29'>and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.30'>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done only that which was evil in my eyes from their youth; for the sons of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they haven't listened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>But they set their detestable things in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I did not command them, neither did it come it into my mind, that they should do this disgusting thing, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>And now therefore this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, concerning this city, of which you{+} say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>Look, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.38'>and they will be my people, and I will be their God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.39'>and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their sons after them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.40'>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.41'>Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.42'>For thus says Yahweh: Like I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.43'>And fields will be bought in this land, of which you{+} say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.44'>Men will buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.33'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.1'>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.2'>Thus says Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it; Yahweh is his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.3'>Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don't know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.4'>For this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down: The mounds and the sword</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.5'>are coming to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of man, whom I have slain in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.6'>Look, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.7'>And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.8'>And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against me, and by which they have transgressed against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.9'>And [this city] will be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory to all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.10'>Thus says Yahweh: Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you{+} say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.11'>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh is good, for his loving-kindness [endures] forever; [and of them] that bring [sacrifices of] thanksgiving into the house of Yahweh. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.12'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.13'>In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, will the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.14'>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.15'>In those days, and at that time, I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.16'>In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will stay safely; and this is what she will be called: Yahweh our righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.17'>For thus says Yahweh: David will not lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.18'>neither will the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to sacrifice continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.19'>And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.20'>Thus says Yahweh: If you{+} can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their season;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.21'>then may also my covenant be broken with David my slave, that he will not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.22'>As the host of heaven can't be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so I will multiply the seed of David my slave, and the Levites that minister to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.33.24'>Have you not considered what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Yahweh chose, he has cast them off? Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.25'>Thus says Yahweh: If [there is] not my covenant of day and night, if I haven't appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.26'>then I will also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my slave, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.34'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.1'>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.2'>This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.3'>and you will not escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes will look at the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth, and you will go to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.4'>Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus says Yahweh concerning you, You will not die by the sword;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.5'>you will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you; and they will lament you, [saying], Ah Lord! For I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.6'>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.7'>when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these [alone] remained of the cities of Judah [as] fortified cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.8'>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.9'>that every man should let his male slave, and every man his female slave, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make slaves of them, [to wit], of a Jew his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.10'>And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his male slave, and every one his female slave, go free, that none should make slaves of them anymore; they obeyed, and let them go:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.11'>but afterward they turned, and caused the male slaves and the female slaves, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for male slaves and for female slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.12'>Therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.13'>This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your{+} fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.14'>At the end of the seven year period you{+} will let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, that has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you will let him go free from you: but your{+} fathers did not listen to me, neither inclined their ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.15'>And you{+} had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his fellow man; and you{+} had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.16'>but you{+} turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his male slave, and every man his female slave, whom you{+} had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you{+} brought them into subjection, to be to you{+} for male slaves and for female slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.17'>Therefore thus says Yahweh: you{+} haven't listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his fellow man: look, I proclaim to you{+} a liberty, says Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you{+} to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.1'>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.2'>Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of Yahweh, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.3'>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.4'>and I brought them into the house of Yahweh, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.5'>And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, Drink{+} wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.6'>But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, You{+} will drink no wine, neither you{+}, nor your{+} sons, forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.7'>neither will you{+} build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your{+} days you{+} will dwell in tents; that you{+} may live many days in the land in which you{+} sojourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.8'>And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.10'>but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.11'>But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.12'>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.16'>Since the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.2'>Take a roll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.3'>It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.4'>Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.5'>And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can't go into the house of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.6'>therefore you go, and read in the roll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in Yahweh's house on the fast-day; and also you will read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.7'>It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.8'>And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Yahweh in Yahweh's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.9'>Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.10'>Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's house, in the ears of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.11'>And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.13'>Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.14'>Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the roll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.15'>And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.16'>Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.17'>And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.18'>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.20'>And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.21'>So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.22'>Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.23'>And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.24'>And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his slaves who heard all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.25'>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.26'>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.27'>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.28'>Take again another roll for yourself, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.29'>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you will say, Thus says Yahweh: You have burned this roll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying, The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and beast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.30'>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have none to sit on the throne of David; and his dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.31'>And I will punish him and his seed and his slaves for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn't listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.32'>Then Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.1'>And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.2'>But neither he, nor his slaves, nor the people of the land, listened to the words of Yahweh, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.3'>And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.4'>Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.5'>And Pharaoh's army came forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.6'>Then the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.7'>This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Thus you{+} will say to the king of Judah, that sent you{+} to me to inquire of me: Look, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you{+}, will return to Egypt into their own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.8'>And the Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city; and they will take it, and burn it with fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.10'>For though you{+} had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you{+}, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.11'>And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.12'>then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.13'>And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.14'>Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he didn't listen to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.15'>And the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.16'>When Jeremiah came into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.17'>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Yahweh? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.18'>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, In what have I sinned against you, or against your slaves, or against this people, that you{+} have put me in prison?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.19'>Where now are your{+} prophets that prophesied to you{+}, saying, The king of Babylon will not come against you{+}, nor against this land?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.21'>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.38.4'>Then the princes said to the king, Let this man, we pray you, be put to death; since he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.5'>And Zedekiah the king said, Look, he is in your{+} hand; for the king is not he who can do anything against you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.6'>Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.7'>Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.8'>Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.38.10'>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.11'>So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.12'>And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.13'>So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.14'>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.38.18'>But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then will this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.19'>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen away to the Chaldeans, in case they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.38.23'>And they will bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans; and you will not escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you will cause this city to be burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.24'>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you will not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.25'>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don't hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.26'>then you will say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.27'>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.40'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.1'>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.2'>And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.3'>and Yahweh has brought it, and done according to as he spoke: because you{+} have sinned against Yahweh, and haven't obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come upon you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.4'>And now, look, I loose you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well to you; but if it seems ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: look, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.5'>Now since he had not yet gone back, [he said] Go back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.6'>Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.7'>Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.8'>then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, [to wit], Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.9'>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Don't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.10'>As for me, look, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that will come to us: but you{+}, gather{+} wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your{+} vessels, and dwell in your{+} cities that you{+} have taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.11'>Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the sons of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.12'>then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.13'>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.14'>and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.15'>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it: why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.41.1'>Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed and [one of] the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.2'>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.3'>Ishmael also slew all the Jews who were with him, [to wit], with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.41.5'>that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.6'>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.7'>And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.8'>But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don't slay us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and did not slay them among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.9'>Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain was the cistern of Gedaliah. This was the one that Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.10'>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.11'>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.41.14'>So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.15'>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.16'>Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, [to wit], the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:</verse>
