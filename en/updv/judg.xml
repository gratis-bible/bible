      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the sons of Israel asked of Yahweh, saying, Who will go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And Yahweh said, Judah will go up: look, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table: as I have done, so God has repaid me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she dismounted from off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, What do you want?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negeb of Arad; and Amalek went and dwelt with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and completely destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out [the inhabitants of] the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Yahweh was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city formerly was Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And he showed them the entrance into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>And Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth-shean and its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites determined to dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass, when Israel was waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to slave labor, and did not completely drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to slave labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to slave labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>but the Amorites determined to dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to slave labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites was the Edomites, from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you{+} to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you{+} to the land which I swore to your{+} fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you{+}:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>and you{+} will make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you{+} will break down their altars. But you{+} haven't listened to my voice: why have you{+} done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you{+}; but they will be [as thorns] in your{+} sides, and their gods will be a snare to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the sons of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the slave of Yahweh, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered{+} to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that didn't know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baalim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Yahweh to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them: and they were very distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>And Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they prostituted after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them: they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh; [but] they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn't cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation transgressed{+} my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and did not listen{+} to my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not, from now on, drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as formerly knew nothing of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>[namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the sons of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the sons of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the sons of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of Yahweh came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>And the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the sons of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>And Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment on his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret message to you, O king. And he said, Keep silent. And all who stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. And he arose out of his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>Now when he had gone out, his slaves came; and they saw, and noticed that the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is relieving himself in the upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they tarried until they were ashamed; and saw that he didn't open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened [them], and saw that their lord had fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it came to pass, when he came, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he [was] before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your{+} enemies the Moabites into your{+} hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn't allow a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every robust man, and every man of valor; and not a man escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest 80 years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the sons of Israel cried to Yahweh: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Has not Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, [saying], Go and draw to mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding, the journey that you take will not be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the sons of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said to Barak, Rise up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand; has not Yahweh gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And Yahweh discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera dismounted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>Nevertheless Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don't be afraid. And he turned in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it will be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, Is there any man here? Then you will say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And, look, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And he came to her; and saw that Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, look, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>And Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you{+} contend for Baal? Or will you{+} save him?

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>But the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>And Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>look, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there will be dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>And Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>And God did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, or else Israel will vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it will be, that of whom I say to you, This will go with you, the same will go with you; and of whomever I say to you, This will not go with you, the same will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he brought down the people to the water: and Yahweh said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him you will set by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>And Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you{+}, and deliver the Midianites into your hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>And they took the provisions of the people in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it came to pass the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, go down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>But if you fear to go down, you and Purah your attendant go down to the camp:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his attendant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And when Gideon came, look, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow soldier; and he said, Look, I dreamed a dream; and saw that a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his fellow soldier answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has delivered into your{+} hand the host of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said to them, Look at me, and do likewise: and, see, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it will be that, as I do, so you{+} will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you{+} blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Yahweh and for Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried, A sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man's sword against his fellow soldier, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian? And they chided with him sharply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>And he said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you{+}? Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>God has delivered into your{+} hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you{+}? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.8.8'>And he went up from there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.9'>And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.10'>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the host of the sons of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he flailed the men of Succoth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.18.1'>In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for itself an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day [its] inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.2'>And the sons of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.3'>When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.4'>And he said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.5'>And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go will be prosperous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.6'>And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before Yahweh is your{+} way in which you{+} go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.7'>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were in it, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one possessing authority that might put [them] to shame in anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.8'>And they came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What [say] you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.9'>And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, look, it is very good: and are you{+} still? Don't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.10'>When you{+} go, you{+} will come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God has given it into your{+} hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.11'>And six hundred men girded with weapons of war set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.12'>And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, to this day; look, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.13'>And they passed from there to the hill-country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.14'>Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, Do you{+} know that there is in these houses an ephod, and talismans, and a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you{+} have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.15'>And they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.16'>And the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.17'>And the five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the talismans, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girded with weapons of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.18'>And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the talismans, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What are you{+} doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.19'>And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.20'>And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the talismans, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.21'>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.22'>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house had gathered together, and stuck to the sons of Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.23'>And they cried to the sons of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.24'>And he said, you{+} have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what more do I have? And how then do you{+} say to me, What ails you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.25'>And the sons of Dan said to him, Don't let your voice be heard among us, or else angry fellows will fall on you{+}, and you will lose your life, with the lives of your household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.26'>And the sons of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.27'>And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.28'>And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.29'>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: nevertheless the name of the city was Laish at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.30'>And the sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.31'>So they set themselves up Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.19'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.1'>And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.2'>And his concubine prostituted against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.3'>And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his attendant with him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.4'>And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he remained with him three days: so they ate and drank, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.5'>And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you{+} will go your{+} way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.6'>So they sat down, and ate and drank, both of them together: and the damsel's father said to the man, Be pleased, I pray you, to tarry all night, and let your heart be merry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.7'>And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.8'>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Strengthen your heart, I pray you, and tarry{+} until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.9'>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his attendant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Look, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you{+} tarry all night: see, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow rise{+} early on your{+} way, that you may go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.10'>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came opposite Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled; his concubine also was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.11'>When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the attendant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.12'>And his master said to him, We will not turn aside into a city of the foreigner, who is not of the sons of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.13'>And he said to his attendant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.14'>So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.15'>And they turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat down in the street of the city; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.16'>And, look, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.17'>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Where do you go? And where do you come from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.18'>And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; I am from there, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am going to the house of Yahweh; and there is no man who takes me into his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.19'>Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your female slave, and for the attendant who is with your slaves: there is no want of anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.20'>And the old man said, Peace be to you; however let all your wants lie on me; only don't lodge in the street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.21'>So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.22'>As they were making their hearts merry, look, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house, that we may have sex with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.23'>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, I pray you{+}, don't do so wickedly; seeing that this man has come into my house, don't do this folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.24'>Look, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble{+} them, and do with them what seems good to you{+}: but to this man don't do any such folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.25'>But the men would not listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.26'>Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, until it was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.27'>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and saw that the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.28'>And he said to her, Rise up, and let us be going; but there was no answer: then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.29'>And when he came into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.30'>And it was so, that all who saw [it] said, [Such a thing] has not happened nor been seen like that from the day the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. And he commanded the men he sent saying, This is what you will say to every man of Israel, Has such [a thing] ever happened from the day the sons of Israel came up from Egypt until this day? Consider it, take counsel, and speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.20'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.1'>Then all the sons of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.2'>And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.3'>(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.4'>And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.5'>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; they wanted to kill me, and they raped my concubine to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.6'>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.7'>Look, you{+} sons of Israel, all of you{+}, give here your{+} advice and counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.8'>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.9'>But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we will go up] against it by lot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.10'>And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Geba of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.11'>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, joined together as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.12'>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that has come to pass among you{+}?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.13'>Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.14'>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.15'>And the sons of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand swordsmen, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.16'>Among all this people there were seven hundred left-handed chosen men; every one could sling stones at a hair-width, and not miss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.17'>And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand swordsmen: all these were men of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.18'>And the sons of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Yahweh said, Judah [will go up] first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.19'>And the sons of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.20'>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.21'>And the sons of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.22'>And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.23'>And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother? And Yahweh said, Go up against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.24'>And the sons of Israel came near against the sons of Benjamin the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.25'>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.26'>Then all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.27'>And the sons of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.28'>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.29'>And Israel set ambushers against Gibeah round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.30'>And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.31'>And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.32'>And the sons of Benjamin said, They are being struck down before us, as at the first. But the sons of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.33'>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out from the clearing of Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.34'>And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was intense; but they didn't know that evil was close on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.35'>And Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the sons of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these [were] swordsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.36'>So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted to the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.37'>And the ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.38'>Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.39'>And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.40'>But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and saw that the whole city went up [in smoke] to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.41'>And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil came upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.42'>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle stuck [close] to them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.43'>They enclosed the Benjamites round about, chased them, [and from their] resting-place they trod them down, near Gibeah toward the sunrising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.44'>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.45'>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and stuck [closely] after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.46'>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand swordsmen; all these [were] men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.47'>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and remained in the rock of Rimmon four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.48'>And the men of Israel turned again on the sons of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword in the town: men to cattle, to all they found. Moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.21'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.1'>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, Not any of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.2'>And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept intensely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.3'>And they said, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.4'>And it came to pass on the next day, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.5'>And the sons of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh? For they had made a great oath concerning him who did not come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He will surely be put to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.10'>And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.14'>And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet they did not suffice them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.15'>And the people repented for Benjamin, because Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.16'>Then the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing the women were destroyed out of Benjamin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.17'>And they said, There must be an inheritance for the escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe will not be blotted out from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.18'>Nevertheless we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.19'>And they said, Look, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.21'>and see, and watch if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come{+} out of the vineyards, and you{+} catch every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>And the sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.21.25'>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</verse>
