      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>And they took themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you{+} to her mother's house: Yahweh deal kindly with you{+}, as you{+} have dealt with the dead, and with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>Yahweh grant you{+} that you{+} may find rest, each of you{+} in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>And they said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you{+} go with me? Have I yet sons inside me, that they may be your{+} husbands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>Turn again, my daughters, go your{+} way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>would you{+} therefore tarry until they were grown? Would you{+} therefore refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your{+} sakes, for the hand of Yahweh has gone forth against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth stuck to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And she said, Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. You return after your sister-in-law!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>And Ruth said, Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people will be my people, and your God my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.19'>So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.20'>And she said to them, Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.21'>I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty; why do you{+} call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.22'>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose eyes I will find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and by chance she happened on the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And, look, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you{+}. And they answered him, Yahweh bless you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>Then Boaz said to his attendant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And the attendant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabite damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>And she said, Let me glean, I pray you{+}, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has remained standing from morning until now; her sitting now in the house [has only been] for a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>Then said Boaz to Ruth, Do you not hear, my daughter? Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from here, but stick here by my maidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: have I not charged the young men that they will not touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>And Boaz answered and said to her, It has fully been shown to me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and have come to a people who you didn't know before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you came to take refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and you have spoken kindly to your female slave, though I am not as one of your female slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And at mealtime Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>And when she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don't reproach her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? And where have you wrought? Blessed be he who took knowledge of you. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought today is Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our near kinsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You will stick by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they don't meet you in any other field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>So she stuck by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>And Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>And now isn't Boaz our kinsman, whose maidens you were with? Look, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put your raiment on you, and go down to the threshing-floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he is done eating and drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>And it will be, when he lies down, that you will mark the place where he will lie, and you will go in, and uncover his feet, and lay down; and he will tell you what you will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>And she said to her, All that you say I will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And when Boaz had ate and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and saw that a woman lay at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your slave: spread therefore your skirt over your slave; for you are a near kinsman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And he said, Blessed be you of Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>And now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>Tarry this night, and it will be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, good; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then I will do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before a man could discern another. For he said, Don't let it be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And he said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>And she said, These six [measures] of barley he gave me; for he said, Don't go empty to your mother-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>Then she said, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there: and, look, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! Turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit{+} down here. And they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>And I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>Then Boaz said, The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you buy from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>And the near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, or else I will mar my own inheritance: you take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his sandal, and gave it to his fellow man; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. And he drew off his sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You{+} are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead will not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you{+} are witnesses this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman that has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, who both built the house of Israel: and do worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh will give you of this young woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>And he will be to you a restorer of life, and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and was its nurse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>And her women neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.</verse>
