        <verse osisID='Num.35.18'>Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.19'>The avenger of blood will himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he will put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.20'>And if he thrusts him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.21'>or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him will surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood will put the murderer to death, when he meets him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.22'>But if he thrusts him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.23'>or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he wasn't his enemy, neither sought his harm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.24'>then the congregation will judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.25'>and the congregation will deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation will restore him to his city of refuge, where he has fled: and he will dwell in it until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.26'>But if the manslayer will at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.27'>and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slays the manslayer; he will not be guilty of blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.28'>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer will return into the land of his possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.29'>And these things will be for a statute [and] ordinance to you{+} throughout your{+} generations in all your{+} dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.30'>Whoever kills any person, the murderer will be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness will not testify against any person that he die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.31'>Moreover you{+} will take no ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death; but he will surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.32'>And you{+} will take no ransom for someone to flee to his city of refuge, to come back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.33'>So you{+} will not pollute the land in which you{+} are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.34'>And you will not defile the land which you{+} inhabit, in the midst of which I stay: for I, Yahweh, stay in the midst of the sons of Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.36'>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.1'>And the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.2'>and they said, Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.3'>And if they are married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they will belong: so it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.4'>And when it will be the jubilee of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they will belong: so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.5'>And Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of Yahweh, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.6'>This is the thing which Yahweh commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; they will be married only into the family of the tribe of their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.7'>So no inheritance of the sons of Israel will remove from tribe to tribe; for the sons of Israel will stick every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.8'>And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel, will be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the sons of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.9'>So no inheritance will remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the sons of Israel will stick every one to his own inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.10'>Even as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.11'>for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.12'>They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.13'>These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.</verse>
