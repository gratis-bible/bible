      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the slave of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my slave is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, even to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your{+} foot will tread on, to you{+} I have given it, as I spoke to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, will be your{+} border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>There will not be any man able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you, nor forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of good courage; for you will cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my slave commanded you: don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law will not depart out of your mouth, but you will meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it: for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; don't be frightened, neither be dismayed: for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves provisions; for within three days you{+} are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh your{+} God gives you{+} to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded you{+}, saying, Yahweh your{+} God gives you{+} rest, and will give you{+} this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your{+} wives, your{+} little ones, and your{+} cattle, will remain in the land which Moses gave you{+} beyond the Jordan; but you{+} will pass over before your{+} brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and will help them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until Yahweh gives your{+} brothers rest, as [he has given] you{+}, and they also have possessed the land which Yahweh your{+} God gives them: then you{+} will return to the land of your{+} possession, and possess it, which Moses the slave of Yahweh gave you{+} beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we listened to Moses in all things, so we will listen to you: only Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whoever he is that will rebel against your commandment, and will not listen to your words in all that you command him, he will be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Look, there came men in here tonight of the sons of Israel to search out the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who came to you, that entered into your house; for they came to search out all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men. And she hid it, and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I didn't know from where they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; where the men went I don't know: pursue after them quickly; for you{+} will overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they were laid down, she came up to them on the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>and she said to the men, I know that Yahweh has given you{+} the land, and that the fear of you{+} is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you{+}, when you{+} came out of Egypt; and what you{+} did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you{+} completely destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain anymore spirit in any man, because of you{+}: for Yahweh your{+} God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you{+}, swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you{+}, that you{+} also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and that you{+} will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all who they have, and will deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men said to her, Our life for yours{+}, if you{+} do not utter this business of ours; then it will be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the side of the wall, and she dwelt on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Go{+} to the mountain, or else the pursuers will fall on you{+}; then hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers return: and afterward may you{+} go your{+} way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her, We will be innocent of this oath of yours which you have made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Look, when we come into the land, you will bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which you have let us down: and you will gather to yourself into the house your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it will be, that whoever will go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be innocent: and whoever will be with you in the house, his blood will be on our head, if any hand is on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>But if you utter this business of ours, then we will be innocent of your oath which you have made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According to your{+} words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And then they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn't find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and they commanded the people, saying, When you{+} see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your{+} God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you{+} will remove from your{+} place, and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there will be a space between you{+} and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: don't come near to it, that you{+} may know the way by which you{+} must go; for you{+} haven't passed this way before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And Yahweh said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And you will command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you{+} come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you{+} will stand still in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your{+} God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, Hereby you{+} will know that the living God is among you{+}, and that he will without fail drive out from before you{+} the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Look, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you{+} into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it will come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, will rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they will stand in one heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those who went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed clean over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the nation had clean passed over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take for yourselves twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command{+} them, saying, Take for yourselves from here out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you{+}, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where you{+} will lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the sons of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your{+} God into the midst of the Jordan, and take{+} up every man of you{+} a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign among you{+}, that, when your{+} sons ask in time to come, saying, What do you{+} mean by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then you{+} will say to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones will be for a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the sons of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hurried and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people had clean passed over, that the ark of Yahweh and the priests moved up before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the sons of Israel, as Moses spoke to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come{+} up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks, as previously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, When your{+} sons will ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then you{+} will let your{+} sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For Yahweh your{+} God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you{+}, until you{+} had passed over, as Yahweh your{+} God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you{+} may fear Yahweh your{+} God forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them anymore, because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made for himself knives of flint, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised: all the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, was consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh: to whom Yahweh swore that he would not let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, Joshua circumcised them: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they remained in their places in the camp, until they were whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And Yahweh said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you{+}. Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the very same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the sons of Israel manna anymore; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that there stood a man across from him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, No; but [as] prince of the host of Yahweh I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What does my lord say to his slave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the prince of Yahweh's host said to Joshua, Put off your sandal from off your foot; for the place on which you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the sons of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And Yahweh said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho and its king, mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And you{+} will circle the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus you will do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark: and the seventh day you{+} will circle the city seven times, and the priests will blow the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it will be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you{+} hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And they said to the people, Pass on, and circle the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua commanded the people, saying, You{+} will not shout, nor let your{+} voice be heard, neither will any word proceed out of your{+} mouth, until the day I bid you{+} shout; then you{+} will shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So he caused the ark of Yahweh to circle the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Yahweh, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they circled the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for Yahweh has given you{+} the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city will be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh: only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But as for you{+}, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, or else you{+} will covet and take of the devoted thing; so you{+} would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy to Yahweh: they will come into the treasury of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted, and [the priests] blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>And they completely destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman, and all who she has, as you{+} swore to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all who she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>But Rahab the prostitute, and her father's household, and all who she had, Joshua saved alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Yahweh, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: with the loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he will set up the gates of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the sons of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there; for they are but few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>And the men of Ai struck of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua said, Alas, O Sovereign Yahweh, why have you at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? Would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do for your great name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>And Yahweh said to Joshua, Get yourself up; why are you thus fallen on your face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yes, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore the sons of Israel can't stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become accursed: I will not be with you{+} anymore, except you{+} destroy the devoted thing from among you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Get up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, There is a devoted thing in the midst of you, O Israel; you can not stand before your enemies, until you{+} take away the devoted thing from among you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>In the morning therefore you{+} will be brought near by your{+} tribes: and it will be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes will come near by families; and the family which Yahweh will take will come near by households; and the household which Yahweh will take will come near man by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.15'>And it will be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing will be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has wrought folly in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; don't hide it from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, look, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, look, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel; and they laid them down before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and heaped stones upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>And they raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day; and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, to this day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>And Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>And you will do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, you{+} will take for a prey to yourselves: set yourself an ambush for the city behind it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, saying, Look, you{+} will lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city, but all of you{+} be ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. And it will come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>and you{+} will rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Yahweh your{+} God will deliver it into your{+} hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And it will be, when you{+} have seized on the city, that you{+} will set the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh you{+} will do: see, I have commanded you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambush, and remained between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And all the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their ambushers who were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, for the encounter toward the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that didn't go out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>And Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And [those in] the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, look, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And all who fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had completely destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised on it a great heap of stones, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>as Moses the slave of Yahweh commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered on it burnt-offerings to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the slave of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who were among them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.9.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.2'>that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Do not slack your hand from your slaves; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand still on Gibeon; And, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst of it: and afterward I brought you{+} out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>And I brought your{+} fathers out of Egypt: and you{+} came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your{+} fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>And when they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you{+} and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your{+} eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you{+} dwelt in the wilderness many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.8'>And I brought you{+} into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you{+}; and I gave them into your{+} hand, and you{+} possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.9'>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.10'>but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you{+} still: so I delivered you{+} out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.11'>And you{+} went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you{+}, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your{+} hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.12'>And I sent the hornet before you{+}, which drove them out from before you{+}, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.13'>And I gave you{+} a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you{+} did not build, and you{+} dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveyards which you{+} did not plant, you{+} are eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.14'>Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your{+} fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve{+} Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.15'>And if it seems evil to you{+} to serve Yahweh, choose you{+} this day whom you{+} will serve; whether the gods which your{+} fathers served who were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you{+} dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.16'>And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.17'>for Yahweh our God, it is he who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>And Joshua said to the people, You{+} can't serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your{+} transgression nor your{+} sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If you{+} forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do evil to you{+}, and consume you{+}, after he has done you{+} good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Joshua said to the people, You{+} are witnesses against yourselves that you{+} have chosen for yourselves Yahweh, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore put away, [he said], the foreign gods which are among you{+}, and incline your{+} heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God we will serve, and to his voice we will listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said to all the people, Look, this stone will be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us: it will therefore be a witness against you{+}, in case you{+} deny your{+} God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the slave of Yahweh, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.30'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.31'>And Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.32'>And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.33'>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the hill-country of Ephraim.</verse>
