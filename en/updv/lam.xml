      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>How the city sits solitary, that was full of people! She has become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become slave labor!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She weeps intensely in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her friends she has none to comfort her: All her companions have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: All her persecutors overtook her inside the straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways of Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her adversaries have become the head, her enemies prosper; For Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty has departed: Her princes have become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her wandering all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none helped her, The adversaries saw her, they mocked at her desolations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become as an unclean thing; All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn't remember her latter end; Therefore she has come down wonderfully; she has no comforter: See, O Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things: For she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Yahweh, and behold; for I have become abject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>Is it nothing to you{+}, all you{+} who pass by? Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought on me, With which Yahweh has afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them; He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: He has made me desolate and faint all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>The yoke of my transgressions is tied by his hand; They are knit together, they have come up on my neck; he has made my strength to fail: The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me; He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My sons are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>Yahweh is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Hear, I pray you{+}, all you{+} peoples, and look at my sorrow: My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: My priests and my elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought food for them to refresh their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>Look, O Yahweh; for I am in distress; my insides are troubled; My heart is turned inside me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it: You have brought the day that you have proclaimed, and they will be like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Let all their wickedness come before you; And do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, And has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied: He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground; he has profaned the kingdom and its princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>He has cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: And he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He has bent his bow like an enemy, he has stood with his right hand as an adversary, And has slain all who were pleasant to the eye: In the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>The Lord has become as an enemy, he has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all her palaces, he has destroyed his strongholds; And he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>And he has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he has destroyed his place of assembly: Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, And has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary; He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: They have made a noise in the house of Yahweh, as in the day of a solemn assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He has stretched out the line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying; And he has made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars: Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground, they keep silent; They have cast up dust on their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>My eyes fail with tears, my insides are troubled; My liver is poured on the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, When their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>What shall I testify to you? What shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions; And they have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captivity, But have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All who pass by clap their hands at you; They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying], Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you; They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed [her] up; Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>Yahweh has done that which he purposed; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old; He has thrown down, and has not pitied: And he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; he has exalted the horn of your adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Their heart cried to the Lord: O walls of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no respite; don't let the apple of your eye cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord: Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>See, O Yahweh, and look at whom you have done thus! Will the women eat their fruit, the children who are cuddled in the hands? Will the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword: You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered, [and] not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side; And there was none who escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh's anger: Those who I have cuddled and brought up, my enemy has consumed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>I am the [noble] man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>My flesh and my skin he has made old; he has broken my bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>He has built against me, and surrounded me with gall and travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>He has walled me about, that I can't go forth; he has made my chain heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'>Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'>He has walled up my ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'>He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>I have become a derision for my whole nation, and their song all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'>He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>And you have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>And I said, My strength has perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>My soul has them still in remembrance, and is bowed down inside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.21'>This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.22'>[It is of] Yahweh's loving-kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions do not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.23'>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.24'>Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore I will hope in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.25'>Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.26'>It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.27'>It is good for a [noble] man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.28'>Let him sit alone and keep silent, because he has laid it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.29'>Let him put his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there may be hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.30'>Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.31'>For the Lord will not cast off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.32'>For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.33'>For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the sons of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.34'>To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.35'>To turn aside the right of a [noble] man before the face of the Most High,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.36'>To subvert man in his cause, the Lord does not approve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.37'>Who is he that says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord does not command it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.38'>Out of the mouth of the Most High does there not come evil and good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.39'>Why does man complain, a living [noble] man for the punishment of his sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.40'>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.41'>Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.42'>We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.43'>You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have slain, you have not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.44'>You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.45'>You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.46'>All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.47'>Fear and the pit have come upon us, devastation and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.48'>My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.49'>My eye pours down, and does not cease, without any intermission,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.50'>Until Yahweh looks down, and beholds from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.51'>My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.52'>They have chased me intensely like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.53'>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.54'>Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.55'>I called on your name, O Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.56'>You heard my voice; don't hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.57'>You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don't be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.58'>O Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.59'>O Yahweh, you have seen my wrong; judge my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.60'>You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.61'>You have heard their reproach, O Yahweh, and all their devices against me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.62'>The lips of those who rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.63'>Look at their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.64'>You will render to them a recompense, O Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.65'>You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.66'>You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.4'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.1'>How has the gold become dim! [How] has the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.2'>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.3'>Even the jackals draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones: The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.4'>The tongue of the nursing child sticks to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.5'>Those who did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.6'>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.7'>Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.8'>Their visage is blacker than a charcoal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin shrivels to their bones; it is withered, it has become like a stick.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.4.10'>The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.11'>Yahweh has accomplished his wrath, he has poured out his fierce anger; And he has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.12'>The kings of the earth did not believe, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.13'>[It is] because of the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.14'>They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men can't touch their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.15'>Depart{+}, they cried to them, Unclean! Depart, depart, don't touch! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They will no more sojourn [here].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.16'>The anger of Yahweh has scattered them; he will no more regard them: They did not respect the persons of the priests, they did not favor the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.17'>Our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.18'>They hunt our steps, so that we can't go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.19'>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us on the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.20'>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Yahweh, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we will live among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.21'>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz: The cup will pass through to you also; you will be drunk, and will make yourself naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.22'>The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you away into captivity: He will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover your sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.5.3'>We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.4'>We have drank our water for money; Our wood is sold to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.5'>Our pursuers are on our necks: We are weary, and have no rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.6'>We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.7'>Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.8'>Slaves rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.9'>We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.10'>Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.11'>They humbled the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.12'>Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.13'>The young men bore the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.14'>The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.15'>The joy of our heart has ceased; Our dance has turned into mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.16'>The crown has fallen from our head: Woe to us! For we have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.17'>For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.18'>For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.19'>You, O Yahweh, remain forever; Your throne is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.20'>Why do you forget us forever, [And] forsake us so long time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.21'>Turn us to you, O Yahweh, and we will be turned; Renew our days as of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.22'>But you have completely rejected us; You are very angry against us.</verse>
