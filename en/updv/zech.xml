      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>Yahweh was very displeased with your{+} fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Therefore you say to them, Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Return to me, says Yahweh of hosts, and I will return to you{+}, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Don't be{+} as your{+} fathers, to whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts, Return{+} now from your{+} evil ways, and from your{+} evil doings: but they did not hear, nor listen to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your{+} fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my slaves the prophets, did they not overtake your{+} fathers? And they turned and said, Like Yahweh of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw in the night, and, look, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man who stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are those whom Yahweh has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, look, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the angel of Yahweh answered and said, O Yahweh of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And Yahweh answered the angel that talked with me with good words, [even] comfortable words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the angel that talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very intensely displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus says Yahweh: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house will be built in it, says Yahweh of hosts, and a line will be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry out yet again, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts: My cities will yet overflow with prosperity; and Yahweh will yet comfort Zion, and will yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And Yahweh showed me four blacksmiths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>Then I said, What do these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width, and what is its length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And, look, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of man and cattle in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>For I, says Yahweh, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says Yahweh; for I have spread you{+} abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>Ho Zion, escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says: After glory he has sent me to the nations which plundered you{+}; for he who touches you{+} touches the apple of my eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For, look, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a spoil to their slaves; and you{+} will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, look, I come, and I will stay in the midst of you, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations will join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and will be my people; and I will stay in the midst of you, and you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has awakened out of his holy habitation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And Yahweh said to Satan, Yahweh rebuke you, O Satan; yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And to him he said, Look, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you also will judge my house, and will also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions that sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, look, I will bring forth my slave the Branch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For, look, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: look, I will engrave its engraving, says Yahweh of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, you{+} will invite every man his fellow man under the vine and under the fig-tree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that talked with me came again, and woke me, as a man who is awakened out of his sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I have seen, and, look, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>and two olive-trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>And I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Don't you know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel [you will become] a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands will also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven will rejoice, and will see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; [these are] the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the gold out of themselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he answered me and said, Don't you know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then he said, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>Then again I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw a flying roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land: for according to this side [of the scroll], everyone who steals will be emptied; and according to the other side, everyone who swears will be emptied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I brought it out, says Yahweh of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will reside in the midst of his house, and will consume it with its timber and its stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now your eyes, and see what this is that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their desire in all the land</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>(and, look, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead on its mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then I said to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And again I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw four chariots come out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>[The chariot] in which are the black horses goes forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Go{+} from here, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then he cried to me, and spoke to me, saying, Look, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and you come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>yes, take [of them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>and speak to him, saying, Thus speaks Yahweh of hosts, saying, Look, the man whose name is the Branch: and he will grow up out of his place; and he will build the temple of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>even he will build the temple of Yahweh; and he will bear the glory, and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns will be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and for the kindness of the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And those who are far off will come and build in the temple of Yahweh; and you{+} will know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you{+}. And [this] will come to pass, if you{+} will diligently obey the voice of Yahweh your{+} God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Darius, that the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, even in Chislev.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>Now [they of] Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>[and] to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then the word of Yahweh of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you{+} fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [month], even these seventy years, did you{+} at all fast to me, even to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when you{+} eat, and when you{+} drink, don't you{+} eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>[Should you{+}] not [hear] the words which Yahweh cried out by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus has Yahweh of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>and don't oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you{+} devise evil against his brother in your{+} heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to listen, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>Yes, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Yahweh of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>And it has come to pass that, as he cried out, and they would not hear, so they will cry out, and I will not hear, said Yahweh of hosts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>And the word of Yahweh of hosts came [to me], saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus says Yahweh: I have returned to Zion, and will stay in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem will be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Yahweh of hosts, The holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: There will yet dwell old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Look, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>and I will bring them, and they will stay in the midst of Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Let your{+} hands be strong, you{+} who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were there in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before those days there was no wage for man, nor any wage for beast; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all of man, every man against his fellow man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For [there will be] the seed of peace; the vine will give its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it will come to pass that, as you{+} were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you{+}, and you{+} will be a blessing. Don't be afraid, [but] let your{+} hands be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says: As I thought to do evil to you{+}, when your{+} fathers provoked me to wrath, says Yahweh of hosts, and I did not repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: don't be{+} afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>These are the things that you{+} will do: speak{+} every man the truth with his fellow man; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your{+} gates;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.17'>and let none of you{+} devise evil in your{+} hearts against his fellow man; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.18'>And the word of Yahweh of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.19'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, will be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.8.22'>Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.23'>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: In those days [it will come to pass], that ten men will take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, We will go with you{+}, for we have heard that God is with you{+}.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.9.1'>The burden of the word of Yahweh on the land of Hadrach, and Damascus [will be] its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.2'>and Hamath, also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.3'>And Tyre built herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.4'>Look, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will strike her power in the sea; and she will be devoured with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.5'>Ashkelon will see it, and fear; Gaza also, and will be very pained; and Ekron, for her expectation will be put to shame; and the king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.6'>And a bastard will dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.7'>And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth; and he also will be a remnant for our God; and he will be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.8'>And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor will pass through them anymore: for now I have seen with my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.9'>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: look, your king comes to you; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on a donkey, even on a colt the son of a donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.10'>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow will be cut off; and he will speak peace to the nations: and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.11'>As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.12'>Turn{+} to the stronghold, you{+} prisoners of hope: even today I declare that I will render double to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.13'>For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and will make you as the sword of a mighty man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.14'>And Yahweh will be seen over them; and his arrow will go forth as the lightning; and the Sovereign Yahweh will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.15'>Yahweh of hosts will defend them; and they will devour, and will tread down the sling-stones; and they will drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they will be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.16'>And Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for [they will be as] the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.9.17'>For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.10.1'>Ask{+} of Yahweh rain in the time of the latter rain, [even of] Yahweh who makes lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.2'>For the talismans have spoken vanity, and the fortune-tellers have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.3'>My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Yahweh of hosts has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.4'>From him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.5'>And they will be as mighty men, treading down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they will fight, because Yahweh is with them; and the riders on horses will be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.6'>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy on them; and they will be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Yahweh their God, and I will hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.7'>And [they of] Ephraim will be like a mighty man, and their heart will rejoice as through wine; yes, their sons will see it, and rejoice; their heart will be glad in Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.8'>I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they will increase as they have increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.9'>And I will sow them among the peoples; and they will remember me in far countries; and they will raise their sons, and will return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.10'>I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] will not be found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.11'>And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will strike the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile will dry up; and the pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.10.12'>And I will strengthen them in Yahweh; and they will walk up and down in his name, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.11'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.1'>Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.2'>Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O you{+} oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest has come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.3'>A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! For their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! For the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.4'>Thus Yahweh my God said: Shepherd the flock of slaughter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.5'>whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and those who sell them say, Blessed be Yahweh, for I am rich; and their own shepherds don't pity them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.6'>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh; but, look, I will deliver man, every man into his fellow man's hand, and into the hand of his king; and they will strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.7'>So I shepherded the flock of slaughter, and the sheep-dealers. And I took to me two poles; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I shepherded the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.8'>And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.9'>Then I said, I will not shepherd you{+}: that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those that are left eat every one the flesh of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.10'>And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.11'>And it was broken in that day; and the sheep-dealers that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.12'>And I said to them, If you{+} think good, give me my wages; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my wages thirty [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.13'>And Yahweh said to me, Cast it to the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter, in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.14'>Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.15'>And Yahweh said to me, Take to yourself yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.16'>For, look, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek that which remains behind, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat [sheep], and will tear their hoofs in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.11.17'>Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaves the flock! The sword will be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm will be clean dried up, and his right eye will be completely darkened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.12.1'>The burden of the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. [Thus] says Yahweh, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man inside him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.2'>look, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about, and on Judah also it will be in the siege against Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.3'>And it will come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all who burden themselves with it will be critically wounded; and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.4'>In that day, says Yahweh, I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.5'>And the chieftains of Judah will say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of hosts their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.6'>In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they will devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and [they of] Jerusalem will yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.7'>Yahweh also will save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not magnify above Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.8'>In that day Yahweh will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he who is feeble among them at that day will be as David; and the house of David will be as God, as the angel of Yahweh before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.9'>And it will come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.10'>And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they will look to me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and will be in bitterness for him, as one who is in bitterness for his firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.11'>In that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.12'>And the land will mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.12.13'>the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.13.3'>And it will come to pass that, when any will yet prophesy, then his father and his mother who begot him will say to him, You will not live; for you speak lies in the name of Yahweh; and his father and his mother who begot him will thrust him through when he prophesies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.4'>And it will come to pass in that day, that the prophets will be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.13.6'>And one will say to him, What are these wounds between your arms? Then he will answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.7'>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the [prominent] man who is my associate, says Yahweh of hosts: strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; and I will turn my hand on the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.13.8'>And it will come to pass, that in all the land, says Yahweh, two parts in it will be cut off and die; but the third will be left in it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.14.3'>Then will Yahweh go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.4'>And his feet will stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives will be divided in the midst of it toward the east and toward the west, [and there will be] a very great valley; and half of the mountain will remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.5'>And you{+} will flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you{+} will flee, like you{+} fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy ones with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.6'>And it will come to pass in that day, that there will not be light; the bright ones will withdraw themselves:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.14.8'>And it will come to pass in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter it will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.9'>And Yahweh will be King over all the earth: in that day Yahweh will be one, and his name one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.10'>All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's wine-presses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.11'>And men will dwell in her, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.12'>And this will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.13'>And it will come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Yahweh will be among them; and they will lay hold every one on the hand of his fellow man, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his fellow man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.14'>And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about will be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.15'>And so will be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the beasts that will be in those camps, as that plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.16'>And it will come to pass, that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.17'>And it will be, that whoever of [all] the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of hosts, on them there will be no rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.18'>And if the family of Egypt does not go up, and does not come, will this not happen to them? This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.19'>This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don't go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.20'>In that day there will be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO YAHWEH; and the pots in Yahweh's house will be like the bowls before the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.14.21'>Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them, and boil in them: and in that day there will be no more a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
