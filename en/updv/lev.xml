        <verse osisID='Lev.1.1'>And Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tent of meeting, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.2'>Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, If man among you{+} offers an oblation to Yahweh, you{+} will offer your{+} oblation of the cattle, [even] of the herd and of the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.3'>If his oblation is a burnt-offering of the herd, he will offer it a male without blemish: he will offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.4'>And he will lay his hand on the head of the burnt-offering; and it will be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.5'>And he will kill the bull before Yahweh: and Aaron's sons, the priests, will present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.6'>And he will flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.7'>And the sons of Aaron the priest will put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on the fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.8'>and Aaron's sons, the priests, will lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.9'>but its insides and its legs he will wash with water: and the priest will burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.10'>And if his oblation is of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he will offer it a male without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.11'>And he will kill it on the side of the altar northward before Yahweh: and Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.12'>And he will cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.13'>but the insides and the legs he will wash with water; and the priest will offer the whole, and burn it on the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.14'>And if his oblation to Yahweh is a burnt-offering of birds, then he will offer his oblation of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.15'>And the priest will bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood will be drained out on the side of the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.16'>and he will take away its crop with its filth, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.17'>and he will rend it by its wings, [but] will not divide it apart; and the priest will burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.1'>And when anyone offers an oblation of a meal-offering to Yahweh, his oblation will be of fine flour; and he will pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.2'>and he will bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he will take thereout his handful of the fine flour of it, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest will burn [it as] its memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.3'>and that which is left of the meal-offering will be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.4'>And when you offer an oblation of a meal-offering baked in the oven, it will be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.5'>And if your oblation is a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it will be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.6'>You will part it in pieces, and pour oil on it: it is a meal-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.7'>And if your oblation is a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it will be made of fine flour with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.8'>And you will bring the meal-offering that is made of these things to Yahweh: and it will be presented to the priest, and he will bring it to the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.9'>And the priest will take up from the meal-offering its memorial, and will burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.10'>And that which is left of the meal-offering will be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.11'>No meal-offering, which you{+} will offer to Yahweh, will be made with leaven; for you{+} will burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.12'>As an oblation of first [fruits] you{+} will offer them to Yahweh: but they will not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.13'>And every oblation of your meal-offering you will season with salt; neither will you allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meal-offering: with all your oblations you will offer salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.14'>And if you offer a meal-offering of first fruits to Yahweh, you will offer for the meal-offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.15'>And you will put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it: it is a meal-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.16'>And the priest will burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain of it, and part of its oil, with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.1'>And if his oblation is a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offers of the herd, whether male or female, he will offer it without blemish before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.2'>And he will lay his hand on the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests will sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.3'>And he will offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.4'>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.5'>And Aaron's sons will burn it on the altar on the burnt-offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.3.9'>And he will offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire fat tail, he will take away close by the backbone; and the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.10'>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.11'>And the priest will burn it on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.12'>And if his oblation is a goat, then he will offer it before Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.13'>and he will lay his hand on the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron will sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.1'>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.2'>Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If anyone will sin unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and will do any one of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.3'>if the anointed priest will sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.4'>And he will bring the bull to the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh; and he will lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.5'>And the anointed priest will take of the blood of the bull, and bring it to the tent of meeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.6'>and the priest will dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh, before the veil of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.7'>And the priest will put of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he will pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.8'>And all the fat of the bull of the sin-offering he will take off from it; the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.13'>And if the whole congregation of Israel should err, and the thing has been hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and are guilty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.14'>when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly will offer a young bull for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.1'>And if anyone sins, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter [it], then he will bear his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.2'>Or if anyone touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it was hidden from him, he became unclean, and he will be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.3'>Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is with which he is unclean, and it is hid from him; when he knows of it, then he will be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.4'>Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever man utters rashly with an oath, and it is hid from him; when he knows of it, then he will be guilty in one of these [things].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.5'>And it will be, when he will be guilty in one of these [things], that he will confess that in which he has sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.6'>and he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.7'>And if his means are not sufficient for a lamb, then he will bring his trespass-offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.8'>And he will bring them to the priest, who will offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but will not divide it apart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.9'>and he will sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.10'>And he will offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.11'>But if his means are not sufficient for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he will bring his oblation for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he will put no oil on it, neither will he put any frankincense on it; for it is a sin-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.12'>And he will bring it to the priest, and the priest will take his handful of it as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: it is a sin-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.13'>And the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven: and it will be the priest's, as the meal-offering.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.15'>If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unintentionally, in the holy things of Yahweh; then he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.16'>and he will make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the holy thing, and will add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.17'>And if anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it, yet he is guilty, and will bear his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.18'>And he will bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he erred unintentionally and didn't know it, and he will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.19'>It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Yahweh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.25.31'>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them will be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they will go out in the jubilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.32'>Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.33'>And when one of the Levites redeems, the house that was sold, in the the city of his possession, will go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.34'>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.35'>And if your brother is waxed poor, and his hand fails with you; then you will uphold him: [as] a stranger [who is a] sojourner he will live with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.36'>Take no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.37'>You will not give him your money on interest, nor give him your victuals for increase.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.25.43'>You will not rule over him with rigor, but will fear your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.44'>And as for your male slave, and your female slave, whom you will have; of the nations that are round about you{+}, of them you{+} will buy a male slave and a female slave.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.25.50'>And he will reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale will be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired worker he will be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.51'>If there are yet many years, according to them he will give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.52'>And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he will reckon with him; according to his years he will give back the price of his redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.53'>As a worker hired year by year he will be with him: he will not rule with rigor over him in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.54'>And if he is not redeemed by these [means], then he will go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his sons with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.25.55'>For to me the sons of Israel are slaves; they are my slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your{+} God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man will accomplish a vow, the persons will be for Yahweh by your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>And your estimation will be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation will be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'>And if it is a female, then your estimation will be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'>And if it is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation will be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'>And if it is from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation will be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation will be three shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if it is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your estimation will be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he is poorer than your estimation, then he will be set before the priest, and the priest will value him; according to the ability of him who vowed will the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it is a beast, of which men offer an oblation to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh will be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He will not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he will at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if it is any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to Yahweh, then he will set the beast before the priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>and the priest will value it, whether it is good or bad: as you the priest value it, so it will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he will add the fifth part of it to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when a man will sanctify his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest will estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest will estimate it, so it will stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he will add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it will be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man will sanctify to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your estimation will be according to its sowing: the sowing of a homer of barley [will be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it will stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest will reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee; and an abatement will be made from your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he will add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it will be assured to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it will not be redeemed anymore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, will be holy to Yahweh, as a field devoted; its possession will be the priest's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if he sanctifies to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest will reckon to him the worth of your estimation to the year of jubilee: and he will give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of jubilee the field will return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all your estimations will be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs will be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstborn among beasts, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man will sanctify it; whether it is ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it is of an unclean beast, then he will ransom it according to your estimation, and will add to it the fifth part of it: or if it is not redeemed, then it will be sold according to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man will devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, will be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>No one devoted, that will be devoted from among man, will be ransomed; he will surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh's: it is holy to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will redeem anything of his tithe, he will add to it the fifth part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth will be holy to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He will not search whether it is good or bad, neither will he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy; it will not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sinai.</verse>
