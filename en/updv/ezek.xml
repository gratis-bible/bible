      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of Yahweh came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Yahweh was there on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked and saw that a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of man under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them had their faces and their wings [thus]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>their wings were joined one to another; they did not turn when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of man; and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side; and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side; the four of them had also the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>And their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they did not turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>And I looked at the living creatures, and saw one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of their four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and the four of them had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel inside a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went in their four directions: they did not turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the awesome crystal to look at, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of man on it above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire inside it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one who spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said to me, Son of Man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said to me, Son of Man, I send you to the sons of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>And the sons are impudent and stiffhearted: I am sending you to them; and you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet will know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And you, Son of Man, don't be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you dwell among scorpions: don't be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And you will speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are in rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But you, Son of Man, hear what I say to you; don't be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And I looked and saw that a hand was put forth to me; and saw that a roll of a book was in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it before me: and it was written inside and outside; and there were written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And he said to me, Son of Man, eat that which you find; eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said to me, Son of Man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your insides with this roll that I give you. Then I ate it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said to me, Son of Man, go, get to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can't understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Look, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint I have made your forehead: don't fear them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, Son of Man, all my words that I will speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get to them of the captivity, to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and there where they were dwelling; and I sat there dismayed among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of Man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to the wicked, You will surely die; and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man will die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die: because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, look, the glory of Yahweh stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But you, Son of Man, look, they will lay bands on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>You also, Son of Man, take for yourself a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And you take to yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it, and it will be besieged, and you will lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Moreover you lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according to] the number of the days that you will lie on it, you will bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And again, when you have accomplished these, you will lie on your right side, and will bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, I have appointed it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And you will set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you will prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, look, I lay bands on you, and you will not turn from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>You take also to yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make yourself bread of them; [according to] the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred and ninety days, you will eat of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And your food which you will eat will be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time you will eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>And you will drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time you will drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And you will eat it as barley cakes, and you will bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And Yahweh said, Even thus will the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then I said, Ah Sovereign Yahweh! Look, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither has there come contaminated flesh into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you will prepare your bread on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said to me, Son of Man, look, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they will drink water by measure, and in dismay:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed a man and his brother, and pine away in their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And you, Son of Man, take yourself a sharp sword; [as] a barber's razor you will take it to yourself, and will cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take yourself balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part you will burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and you will take a third part, and strike with the sword round about it; and a third part you will scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>And you will take of them a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>And of these again you will take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom will a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they haven't walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you{+}, and haven't walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you{+};</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in you that which I haven't done, and to which I will not do anymore the like, because of all your disgusting behaviors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers will eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons will eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you; and the whole remnant of you I will scatter to all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, as I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your disgusting behaviors, therefore I also will shave [you off]; neither will my eye spare, and I also will have no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and with famine they will be consumed in the midst of you; and a third part will fall by the sword round about you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus will my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted; and they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all who pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about you, when I will execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Yahweh, have spoken it;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>when I will send on them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you{+}: and I will increase the famine on you{+}, and will break your{+} staff of bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>and I will send on you{+} famine and evil beasts, and they will bereave you; and pestilence and blood will pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of Man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and say, You{+} mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Yahweh: Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Look, I, even I, will bring a sword on you{+}, and I will destroy your{+} high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your{+} altars will become desolate, and your{+} sun-images will be broken; and I will cast down your{+} slain men before your{+} idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your{+} bones round about your{+} altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your{+} dwelling-places the cities will be laid waste, and the high places will be desolate; that your{+} altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your{+} idols may be broken and cease, and your{+} sun-images may be cut down, and your{+} works may be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain will fall in the midst of you{+}, and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you{+} will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you{+} will be scattered through the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And those of you{+} who escape will remember me among the nations where they will be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which prostitute after their idols: and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their disgusting behaviors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they will know that I am Yahweh: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas! Because of all the evil disgusting behaviors of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He who is far off will die of the pestilence; and he who is near will fall by the sword; and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine: thus I will accomplish my wrath on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>And you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men will be among their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>And you, Son of Man, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to the land of Israel, An end: the end has come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your disgusting behaviors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.4'>And my eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your disgusting behaviors will be in the midst of you: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.6'>An end has come, the end has come; it awakes against you; look, it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.7'>Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land: the time has come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, on the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.8'>Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your disgusting behaviors.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.11'>Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [will remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither will there be eminency among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.12'>The time has come, the day draws near: don't let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all their multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.13'>For the seller will not return to that which is sold, although they are yet alive: for the vision is concerning their whole multitude, none will return; neither will any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.14'>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all their multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.15'>The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside: he who is in the field will die with the sword: and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.16'>But the ones of those who escape will escape, and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.17'>All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.18'>They will also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them; and shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.20'>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their disgusting things [and] their detestable things in it: therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.21'>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they will profane it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.23'>Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.24'>Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places will be profaned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.25'>Destruction comes; and they will seek peace, and there will be none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.26'>Mischief will come upon mischief, and rumor will be on rumor; and they will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.27'>The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts I will judge them; and they will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Sovereign Yahweh fell there on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>Then I looked and saw a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner [court] that looks toward the north; where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And, look, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>Then he said to me, Son of Man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and look, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>And he said to me, Son of Man, do you see what they do? Even the great disgusting things that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great disgusting things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And he brought me to the door of the court; and I looked and saw a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then he said to me, Son of Man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, look, a door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>And he said to me, Go in, and see the wicked disgusting things that they do here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in and saw; and look, every form of creeping things, and detestable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the wall round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then he said to me, Son of Man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? For they say, Yahweh does not see us; Yahweh has forsaken the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>He also said to me, You will again see yet other great disgusting things which they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh's house which was toward the north; and look, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], O Son of Man? You will again see yet greater disgusting things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>And he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh's house; and look, at the door of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Yahweh, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], O Son of Man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, look, they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore I will also deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause{+} those who have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And look, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, on which it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>And Yahweh said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and that cry over all the disgusting things that are done in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>And to the others he said in my hearing, Go{+} through the city after him, and strike: don't let your{+} eye spare, neither have{+} pity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>slay completely the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but don't come near any man on whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men who were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go{+} forth. And they went forth, and struck in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it came to pass, while they were striking, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Sovereign Yahweh! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting [of judgment]: for they say, Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh does not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>And as for me also, my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And look, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>Then I looked, and saw that in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>And he spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>And the glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [of it], and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>And there appeared in the cherubim the form of man's hand under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>And I looked, and saw, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>And as for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, as if a wheel had been inside a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they didn't turn as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that the four of them had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.13'>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling [wheels].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.15'>And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.16'>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.17'>When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.18'>And the glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.19'>And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.20'>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.21'>Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of man was under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.22'>And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.1'>And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.2'>Son of Man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear{+} the word of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.3'>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.4'>O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.5'>You{+} have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.6'>They have seen falsehood and a lying psychic reading, that say, Yahweh says; but Yahweh has not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.7'>Have you{+} not seen a false vision, and have you{+} not spoken a lying psychic reading, in that you{+} say, Yahweh says; albeit I haven't spoken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.8'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, look, I am against you{+}, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.9'>And my hand will be against the prophets that see false visions, and that tell lying fortunes: they will not be in the council of my people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the land of Israel; and you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.10'>Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one builds up a wall, look, they daub it with untempered [mortar]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.11'>say to those who daub it with untempered [mortar], that it will fall: there will be an overflowing shower; and you{+}, O great hailstones, will fall; and a stormy wind will rend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.12'>Look, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you{+}, Where is the daubing with which you{+} have daubed it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.13'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.14'>So I will break down the wall that you{+} have daubed with untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; and it will fall, and you{+} will be consumed in the midst of it: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.15'>Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have daubed it with untempered [mortar]; and I will say to you{+}, The wall is no more, neither those who daubed it;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.20'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against your{+} pillows, with which you{+} there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your{+} arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls who you{+} hunt to make [them] fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.21'>Your{+} kerchiefs also I will tear, and deliver my people out of your{+} hand, and they will be no more in your{+} hand to be hunted; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.22'>Because with lies you{+} have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.38'>And I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.39'>I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and they will strip you of your clothes, and take your fair jewels; and they will leave you naked and bare.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.51'>Neither did Samaria commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your disgusting behaviors more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the disgusting things that you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.52'>You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins you are more disgusting than they, they are more righteous than you: yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.53'>And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives in the midst of them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.10'>Yes, look, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not completely wither, when the east wind touches it? It will wither on the rows where it grew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.11'>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.12'>Say now to the rebellious house, Don't you{+} know what these things mean? Tell them, Look, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to himself to Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.13'>and he took of the royal seed, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.14'>that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.15'>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he escape that does such things? Will he break the covenant, and yet escape?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.16'>As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.17'>Neither will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.18'>For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and look, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things; he will not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.19'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it on his own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.20'>And I will spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.21'>And all his places of refuge with all his bands will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered toward every wind: and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.22'>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.23'>in the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it will stay all birds of every wing; in the shade of its branches they will stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.24'>And all the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.1'>The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.2'>What do you{+} mean, that you{+} use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.3'>As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, you{+} will not have [occasion] anymore to use this proverb in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.4'>Look, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.5'>But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.6'>and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his fellow man's wife, neither has come near to a woman in her impurity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.7'>and has not wronged any, but has restored his pledge for debt, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.8'>he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.10'>If he begets a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, and is one who does this type of thing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.11'>and not only does this type of thing, but also has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his fellow man's wife,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.14'>Now, look, if he begets a son, that sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and he sees, and does not do such;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.15'>that has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his fellow man's wife,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.17'>that has withdrawn his hand from the poor, that has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he will not die for the iniquity of his father, he will surely live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.18'>As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, look, he will die in his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.19'>Yet you{+} say, Why doesn't the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.20'>The soul who sins will die: the son will not bear the iniquity of the father, neither will the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous will be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.31'>Cast away all your{+} transgressions from you{+}, by which you{+} have transgressed through them; and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you{+} die, O house of Israel?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.1'>And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Yahweh, and sat before me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.6'>in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.7'>And I said to them, Cast{+} away every man the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Yahweh your{+} God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.8'>But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt.

        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.19'>Also, you Son of Man, appoint for yourself two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they will both come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.20'>You will appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.21'>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to tell his fortune: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the talismans, he looked in the liver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.22'>In his right hand was the reading [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.23'>And it will be to them as a false reading in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.24'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you{+} have made your{+} iniquity to be remembered, in that your{+} transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your{+} doings your{+} sins appear; because you{+} have come to remembrance, you{+} will be taken with the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.25'>And you, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.26'>thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; this [will be] no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.27'>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: neither has this taken place, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it [to him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.28'>And you, Son of Man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh concerning the sons of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.29'>while they see for you false visions, while they tell you a lying fortune, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.30'>Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, I will judge you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.31'>And I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.32'>You will be for fuel to the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land; you will be no more remembered: for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.1'>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.3'>And you will say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that makes idols against herself to defile her!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.4'>You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near, and have come even to your years: therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.11'>And one has done a disgusting thing with his fellow man's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.12'>In you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your fellow men by oppression, and have forgotten me, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.13'>Look, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the midst of you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.18'>Son of Man, the house of Israel has become dross to me: all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.25'>There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.27'>Her princes in the midst of it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.23'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of Man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>and they prostituted in Egypt; they prostituted in their youth; where their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were caressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>And Oholah prostituted when she was mine; and she lusted after her lovers, on the nearby Assyrians,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>And she bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomever she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they caressed her virgin nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she lusted after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and they slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her prostitutions which were more than the prostitutions of her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She lusted after the nearby Assyrians, governors and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.13'>And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>And she increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them princes to look at, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.16'>And as soon as she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.17'>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.18'>So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like my soul was alienated from her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had prostituted in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.20'>And she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.21'>Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when from Egypt they caressed your nipples and squeezed your youthful breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.22'>Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.23'>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.24'>And they will come against you equipped with chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they will set themselves against you with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.25'>And I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury; they will take away your nose and your ears; and your residue will fall by the sword: they will take your sons and your daughters; and your residue will be devoured by the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.26'>They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.27'>Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution [brought] from the land of Egypt; so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.28'>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.29'>and they will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare; and the nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>These things will be done to you, for that you have prostituted after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You will drink of your sister's cup, which is deep and large; you will be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>You will even drink it and drain it out, and you will gnaw its sherds, and will tear your breasts; for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your prostitution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>Yahweh said moreover to me: Son of Man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their disgusting behaviors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] to them for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, look, thus they have done in the midst of my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>And furthermore you{+} have sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent, and, see, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, on which you set my incense and my oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and men of the multitude of man were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now they will still prostitute with her, and she [with them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>And they went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>And righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your{+} lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.49'>And they will recompense your{+} lewdness on you{+}, and you{+} will bear the sins of your{+} idols; and you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.24'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.1'>Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.2'>Son of Man, write for yourself the name of the day, [even] of this very same day: the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this very same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.3'>And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Set on the cauldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.5'>Take the choice of the flock, and also pile the bones under it; make it boil well; yes, its bones were boiled in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.6'>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Woe to the bloody city, to the cauldron whose rust is in it, and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece; No lot has fallen on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.7'>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.8'>That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.10'>Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.11'>Then set it empty on its coals, that it may be hot, and its bronze may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.13'>In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed you and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed from your filthiness anymore, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.14'>I, Yahweh, have spoken it: it will come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, they will judge you, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.15'>Also the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.16'>Son of Man, look, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you will neither mourn nor weep, neither will your tears run down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.17'>Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind your headtire on you, and put your sandals on your feet, and don't cover your lips, and don't eat the bread of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.3'>Look, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.4'>The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: its rivers ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.5'>Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot [them] forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.6'>All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.8'>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.9'>I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.10'>Therefore thus said the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top to [reach] among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.11'>I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he will surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.13'>On his ruin all the birds of the heavens will stay, and all the beasts of the field will be on his branches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.14'>to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top to [reach] among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, [even] all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the sons of man, with those who go down to the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.15'>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers; and the great waters were kept back; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.16'>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.31.17'>They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, [that] dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.36.32'>I don't do [this] for your{+} sake, says the Sovereign Yahweh, be it known to you{+}: be ashamed and confounded for your{+} ways, O house of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.1'>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in the very same day, the hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.2'>In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was, as it were the frame of a city on the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.3'>And he brought me there; and, look, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.4'>And the man said to me, Son of Man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you, you were brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.5'>And, look, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.6'>Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.7'>And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.8'>He measured also the porch of the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.9'>eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.40.10'>And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; the three of them were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.41'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.1'>And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the width of the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.2'>And the width of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.3'>Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.4'>And he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the most holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.5'>Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.6'>And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold, and not have hold in the wall of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.7'>And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed [the house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the width of the house [continued] upward; and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the middle [chamber].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.8'>I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.9'>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits, and that which was left of the structure of the side rooms which belonged to the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.10'>And between the chambers was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.41.16'>the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.12'>so were also the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.13'>Then he said to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests who are near to Yahweh will eat the most holy things: there they will lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.14'>When the priests enter in, then they will not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they will lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they will put on other garments, and will approach to that which pertains to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.15'>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.16'>He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</verse>
