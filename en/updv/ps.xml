      <chapter osisID='Ps.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>BOOK I. Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked; and in the way of sinners, does not stand, and in the seat of scoffers, does not sit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But rather in the law of Yahweh, does he delight; and in his law does he meditate, day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he is like a tree planted by streams of water: its fruit it yields in season, and its leaf does not wither, and in all that he does, he prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>Not so are the wicked: but rather they are like chaff, which is blown away by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment; nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked, will perish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Yahweh, and against his anointed, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>Let us break apart their bonds, And cast away from us their cords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He who sits in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then he will speak to them in his wrath, And in his intense displeasure, he will vex them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Yet I have set my king On Zion my holy hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will tell of the decree: Yahweh said to me, You are my son; This day I have begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of me, and I will give [you] the nations for your inheritance; And for your possession, the uttermost parts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>You will shepherd them with a rod of iron; Like a potter's vessel, you will dash them in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Now therefore you{+} kings, be wise; Be instructed, you{+} judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve Yahweh with fear, And rejoice with trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Embrace purity, or else he will be angry, and you{+} will perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Yahweh, how are my adversaries increased! Many are those who rise up against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But you, O Yahweh, are a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>I cry to Yahweh with my voice, And he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I laid myself down and slept; I awakened; For Yahweh sustains me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Arise, O Yahweh; save me, O my God: For you have struck all my enemies on the cheek bone; You have broken the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>Salvation belongs to Yahweh: Your blessing be on your people. Selah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; You have set me at large [when I was] in distress: Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>O you{+} sons of a man, how long will my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you{+} love vanity? Will you{+} seek after falsehood? Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>Stand in awe, and don't sin: Commune with your{+} own heart on your{+} bed, and be still. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your{+} trust in Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>Many there are that say, Who will show us [any] good? Yahweh, lift up the light of your countenance on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>You have put gladness in my heart, More than [they have] when their grain and their new wine are increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep; For you, Yahweh, alone make me dwell in safety.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.2'>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for to you I will pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>O Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice; In the morning I will order [my prayer] to you, and will keep watch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness: Evil will not sojourn with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The arrogant will not stand in your sight: You hate all workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>You will destroy those who speak lies: Yahweh is disgusted by the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, in the abundance of your loving-kindness I will come into your house: In your fear I will worship toward your holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, O Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies; Make your way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is much wickedness; Their throat is an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, Because you defend them: Let them also that love your name be joyful in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.12'>For you will bless the righteous; O Yahweh, you will circle him with favor as with a shield.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.6.2'>Have mercy on me, O Yahweh; for I am withered away: Heal me, O Yahweh; for my bones are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul also is intensely troubled: And you, O Yahweh, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O Yahweh, deliver my soul: Save me for your loving-kindness' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.5'>For in death there is no remembrance of you: In Sheol who will give you thanks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.6'>I am weary with my groaning; Every night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.7'>My eye wastes away because of grief; It waxes old because of all my adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.8'>Depart from me, all you{+} workers of iniquity; For Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.9'>Yahweh has heard my supplication; Yahweh will receive my prayer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>O Yahweh my God, if I have done this; If there is iniquity in my hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me; (Yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, And cause my glory to stay in the dust. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Arise, O Yahweh, in your anger; Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries, And awake for me; you have commanded judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.7'>And let the congregation of the peoples circle you about; And over them you return on high.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.7.15'>He has made a pit, and dug it, And has fallen into the ditch which he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.16'>His mischief will return on his own head, And his violence will come down on the top of his own head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.9.6'>The enemy have come to an end, they are desolate forever; And the cities which you have overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.7'>But Yahweh sits [as king] forever: He has prepared his throne for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.8'>And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will judge the peoples in uprightness.</verse>
