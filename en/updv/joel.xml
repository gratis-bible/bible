      <chapter osisID='Joel.1'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'>The word of Yahweh that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'>Hear this, you{+} old men, and give ear, all you{+} inhabitants of the land. Has this been in your{+} days, or in the days of your{+} fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'>Tell{+} your{+} sons of it, and [let] your{+} sons [tell] their sons, and their sons another generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'>That which the palmer-worm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'>Awake, you{+} drunkards, and weep; and wail, all you{+} drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your{+} mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'>For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the jaw-teeth of a lioness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'>He has laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he has made it clean bare, and cast it away; its branches are made white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'>The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Yahweh; the priests, Yahweh's ministers, mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'>The field is laid waste, the land mourns; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'>Be confounded, O you{+} husbandmen, wail, O you{+} vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field has perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'>The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languishes; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy has withered away from the sons of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'>Gird yourselves [with sackcloth], and lament, you{+} priests; wail, you{+} ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, you{+} ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withheld from the house of your{+} God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'>Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men [and] all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Yahweh your{+} God, and cry to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'>Alas for the day! For the day of Yahweh is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty it will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'>Is not the food cut off before our eyes, [yes], joy and gladness from the house of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'>The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'>How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'>O Yahweh, to you I will cry; for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'>Yes, the beasts of the field pant to you; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'>Blow{+} the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Yahweh comes, for it is near at hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'>a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread on the mountains; a great and a strong people; there has not ever been the like, neither will [there] be anymore after them, even to the years of many generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'>A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and none has escaped them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so they run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'>At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'>They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they do not proceed in a confused manner on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'>Neither does one thrust another; they march every [able-bodied] man in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and don't break off [their course].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'>They leap on the city; they run on the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'>The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'>And Yahweh utters his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executes his word; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome; and who can endure it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'>Yet even now, says Yahweh, turn{+} to me with all your{+} heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'>and rend your{+} heart, and not your{+} garments, and turn to Yahweh your{+} God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness, and repents of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'>Who knows whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering to Yahweh your{+} God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'>gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those who are nursed by the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare your people, O Yahweh, and don't give your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'>And Yahweh answered and said to his people, Look, I will send you{+} grain, and new wine, and oil, and you{+} will be satisfied with them; and I will no more make you{+} a reproach among the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'>but I will remove far off from you{+} the northern [army], and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench will come up, and its ill savor will come up, because it has done great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'>Don't be afraid, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Yahweh has done great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'>Don't be afraid, you{+} beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine yield their strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'>Be glad then, you{+} sons of Zion, and rejoice in Yahweh your{+} God; for he gives you{+} the former rain in just measure, and he causes to come down for you{+} the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'>And the floors will be full of wheat, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'>And I will restore to you{+} the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you{+}.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'>And you{+} will eat in plenty and be satisfied, and will praise the name of Yahweh your{+} God, that has dealt wondrously with you{+}; and my people will never be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'>And you{+} will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Yahweh your{+} God, and there is no other; and my people will never be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.28'>And it will come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your{+} sons and your{+} daughters will prophesy, your{+} old men will dream dreams, your{+} young men will see visions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.29'>and also on the male slaves and on the female slaves in those days I will pour out my Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.30'>And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.31'>The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and awesome day of Yahweh comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.32'>And it will come to pass, that whoever will call on the name of Yahweh will be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, as Yahweh has said, and among the remnant those whom Yahweh calls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.3'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.1'>For, look, in those days, and in that time, when I will bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.2'>I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.3'>and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.4'>Yes, and what are you{+} to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you{+} render me a recompense? And if you{+} recompense me, swiftly and speedily I will return your{+} recompense on your{+} own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.5'>Since you{+} have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your{+} temples my goodly precious things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.6'>and have sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians, that you{+} may remove them far from their border;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.7'>look, I will stir them up out of the place where you{+} have sold them, and will return your{+} recompense on your{+} own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.8'>and I will sell your{+} sons and your{+} daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Yahweh has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.9'>Proclaim{+} this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.10'>Beat your{+} plowshares into swords, and your{+} pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.11'>Hurry{+}, and come, all you{+} nations round about, and gather yourselves together: there cause your mighty ones to come down, O Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.12'>Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the nations round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.13'>Put{+} in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread{+}; for the wine press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.14'>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.15'>The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.16'>And Yahweh will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will shake: but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people, and a stronghold to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.17'>So you{+} will know that I am Yahweh your{+} God, staying in Zion my holy mountain: then Jerusalem will be holy, and there will no strangers pass through her anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.18'>And it will come to pass in that day, that the mountains will drop down sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters; and a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh, and will water the valley of Shittim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.19'>Egypt will be a desolation, and Edom will be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the sons of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.20'>But Judah will remain forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.21'>And I will make their blood innocent, that I have not made innocent: for Yahweh stays in Zion.</verse>
