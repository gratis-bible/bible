        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, in which is their seed, on the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, in which is their seed, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created the man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them: and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Look, I have given you{+} every herb yielding seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you{+} it will be for food:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that he had made, and, look, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth: and the man was not [there] to till the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And Yahweh God formed the man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which circles the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that circles the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it, which goes in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you will not eat of it: for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And Yahweh God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make a matching helper for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them to the man to see what he would call them: and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there wasn't found a matching helper for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>and the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she will be called a woman, because she was taken out of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore will a man leave his father and his mother, and will stick to his wife: and they will be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Yahweh God had made. And he said to the woman, has God really said, You{+} will not eat of any tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You{+} will not eat of it, neither will you{+} touch it, or else you{+} will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman, You{+} will not surely die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>for God knows that in the day you{+} eat of it, then your{+} eyes will be opened, and you{+} will be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, Where are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you that you should not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And Yahweh God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And Yahweh God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly you will go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: he will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you will bring forth sons; and your desire will be to your husband, and he will rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You will not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>thorns also and thistles it will bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>in the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust you will return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And Yahweh God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And Yahweh God said, Look, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, so that he doesn't put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man; and he caused the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to stay at the east of the garden of Eden to keep the way of the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And the man had sex with his wife Eve; and she became pregnant, and gave birth to Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abel, he also brought of the firstborns of his flock and of its fat. And Yahweh had respect to Abel and to his offering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but to Cain and to his offering he did not have respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And Yahweh said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why is your countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If you do well, will it not be lifted up? And if you do not well, sin is crouching at the door: and to you will be its desire, but you will rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And Yahweh said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I don't know: am I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>from now on when you till the ground, it will not yield its strength to you; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to Yahweh, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Look, you have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from your face I will be hid; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whoever finds me will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And Yahweh said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should strike him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain had sex with his wife; and she became pregnant, and gave birth to Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begot Mehujael: and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; You{+} wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain will be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam had sex with his wife; and she bore a son, and named him Seth. For, [she said], God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he named him Enosh. Then it was begun to call on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This is the Book of the Generations of Adam. In the day that God created Adam, in the likeness of God he made him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>And Adam lived 130 years, and begot [a son] in his own likeness, after his image; and named him Seth:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.30.32'>I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] will be my wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.33'>So will my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when you will come concerning my wages that are before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that [if found] with me, will be counted stolen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.34'>And Laban said, Agreed, let it be according to your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.35'>And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.36'>and he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob shepherded the rest of Laban's flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.37'>And Jacob took for himself rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.30.40'>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them to Laban's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.41'>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.1'>And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's he has gotten all this glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.2'>And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and, look, it was not toward him as formerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.3'>And Yahweh said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.4'>And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.6'>And you{+} know that with all my power I have served your{+} father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.7'>And your{+} father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God didn't allow him to hurt me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.9'>Thus God has taken away the cattle of your{+} father, and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.10'>And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, look, the he-goats which leaped on the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.11'>And the angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.13'>I am the God of Beth-el, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your nativity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.14'>And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.15'>Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.17'>Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.26'>And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.27'>Why did you flee secretly, and steal away from me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.28'>and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.29'>It is in the power of my hand to do you{+} harm: but the God of your{+} father spoke to me last night, saying, You be careful that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.30'>And now, [though] you would surely be gone, because you intensely longed after your father's house, [yet] why have you stolen my gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.31'>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said if I don't, you will take your daughters from me by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.32'>With whomever you find your gods, he will not live: before our brothers discern for yourself what is yours with me, and take it with you. For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.33'>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female slaves; but he didn't find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.34'>Now Rachel had taken the talismans, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. And Laban felt all about the tent, but didn't find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.35'>And she said to her father, Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me. And he searched, but didn't find the talismans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.36'>And Jacob was angry, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.37'>Whereas you have felt all about my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may judge between us two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.38'>These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats haven't cast their young, and the rams of your flocks I have not eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.39'>That which was torn of beasts I didn't bring to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.40'>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.41'>These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock: and you have changed my wages ten times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.42'>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.43'>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their sons whom they have borne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.44'>And now come, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.45'>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.46'>And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there by the heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.47'>And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.48'>And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.31.50'>If you will afflict my daughters, and if you will take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.51'>And Laban said to Jacob, Look at this heap, and look at the pillar, which I have set between me and you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.52'>This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.53'>May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.54'>And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.32.7'>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.8'>and he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.9'>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh, who said to me, Return to your country, and to your kindred, and I will do you good:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.10'>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving-kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your slave; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.11'>Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him. Or else, he will come and strike me, from mother to sons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.32.13'>And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.14'>two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.15'>thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.16'>And he delivered them into the hand of his slaves, every drove by itself, and said to his slaves, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.17'>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? And where do you go? And whose are these before you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.18'>Then you will say [They are] your slave Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, look, he also is behind us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.19'>And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this manner you{+} will speak to Esau, when you{+} find him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.41.21'>and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'>And the reason the dream was doubled to Pharaoh is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'>Now therefore let Pharaoh seek out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.41.36'>And the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.37'>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his slaves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.46.25'>These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: seven souls in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.26'>All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, excluding Jacob's daughters-in-law, were sixty-six souls in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.27'>And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, were nine souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came with Jacob into Egypt, were seventy-five souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.28'>Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to show Joseph the way to [them in] Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.29'>And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.30'>And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are yet alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.31'>And Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.32'>and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.33'>And it will come to pass, when Pharaoh will call you{+}, and will say, What is your{+} occupation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.46.34'>Then you{+} will say, Your slaves have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that you{+} may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is disgusting to the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.47'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.1'>Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and, look, they are in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.2'>And from among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.3'>And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your{+} occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your slaves are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.4'>And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land we have come; for there is no pasture for your slaves' flocks; for the famine is intense in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your slaves dwell in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.5'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know that there are among them capable men, put them in charge of my herds. And Jacob and his sons came to Egypt to Joseph, and Pharaoh the king of Egypt heard it. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Your father and your brothers have come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.6'>Look, the land of Egypt is before you. You may settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.7'>And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.8'>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.9'>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they haven't attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.10'>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.11'>And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.12'>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.13'>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very intense, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.14'>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.15'>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? For [our] money fails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.16'>And Joseph said, Give your{+} cattle; and I will give it to you{+} for your{+} cattle, if you{+} are out of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.17'>And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.18'>And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.19'>why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land not be desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.20'>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was intense on them: and the land became Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.21'>And as for the people, he made them slaves from one end of the border of Egypt even to its other end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.22'>Only the land of the priests he didn't buy: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they didn't sell their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.23'>Then Joseph said to the people, Look, I have bought you{+} this day and your{+} land for Pharaoh: look, here is seed for you{+}, and you{+} will sow the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>And it will come to pass at the ingatherings, that you{+} will give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your{+} own, for seed of the field, and for your{+} food, and for them of your{+} households, and for food for your{+} little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got possessions in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: don't bury me, I pray you, in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but when I sleep with my fathers, you will carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as you have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Look, your father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>And one told Jacob, and said, Look, your son Joseph comes to you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and said to me, Look, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>And your issue, that you beget after them, will be yours; they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>And Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, look, God has let me see your seed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it was evil in his eyes: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great: nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>And he blessed them that day, saying, In you [Joseph] will Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.21'>And Israel said to Joseph, Look, I die: but God will be with you{+}, and bring you{+} again to the land of your{+} fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.22'>Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.49'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.1'>And Jacob called to his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you{+} that which will befall you{+} in the latter days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.2'>Assemble yourselves, and hear, you{+} sons of Jacob; And listen to Israel your{+} father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.3'>Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The preeminence of dignity, and the preeminence of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.4'>Boiling over as water, you will not have the preeminence; Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled it: he went up to my couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.5'>Simeon and Levi are brothers; They determined to destroy violently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.6'>O my soul, don't come into their council; To their assembly, my glory, don't be united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.7'>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.8'>Judah, you will your brothers praise: Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons will bow down before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.9'>Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who will rouse him up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.10'>The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes: And to him will the obedience of the peoples be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.11'>Binding his foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He has washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.12'>His eyes will be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.13'>Zebulun will stay at the haven of the sea; And he will be for a haven of ships; And his border will be on Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.14'>Issachar is a strong donkey, Couching down between the sheepfolds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.15'>And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became slave labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.16'>Dan will judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.17'>Dan will be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.49.23'>The archers have intensely grieved him because they shot at him, and persecuted him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.24'>But his bow remained firm, and the arms of his hands were agile, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, Israel's shepherd and rock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.25'>Even by the God of your father, who will help you, And by the Almighty, who will bless you, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.50.1'>And Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him.</verse>
