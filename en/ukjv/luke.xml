  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; (o. logos)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto you in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>That you might know the certainty of those things, (o. logos) wherein you have been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elisabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit (o. pneuma) and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto you, and to show you these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, (o. logos) which shall be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favoured, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, (o. logos) and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favour with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit (o. pneuma) shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing (o. rhema) shall be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word. (o. rhema) And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit: (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, lo, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit (o. pneuma) has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings (o. rhema) were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, (o. pneuma) and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a crib; because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this shall be a sign unto you; All of you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a crib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing (o. rhema) which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a crib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying (o. rhema) which was told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things, (o. rhema) and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit (o. pneuma) was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit (o. pneuma) into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, according to your word: (o. rhema)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For mine eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which you have prepared before the face of all people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(Yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, (o. pneuma) filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said unto them, How is it that all of you sought me? know all of you not that I must be about my Father's business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the saying (o. rhema) which he spoke unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings (o. rhema) in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word (o. rhema) of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words (o. logos) of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare all of you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answers and says unto them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word (o. logos) of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Whether is easier, to say, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that all of you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto you, Arise, and take up your couch, and go into yours house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he spoke also a parable unto them; No man puts a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new makes a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agrees not with the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no man puts new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>He is like a man which built an house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>Now when he had ended all his sayings (o. rhema) in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto you: but say in a word, (o. logos) and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto you, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet has risen up among us; and, That God has visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this rumour (o. logos) of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist has sent us unto you, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; (o. pneuma) and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things all of you have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went all of you out into the wilderness in order to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>And the Lord said, Unto which then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and all of you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and all of you have not wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified of all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at food in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him: for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto you. And he says, Master, say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Wherefore I say unto you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said unto her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And they that sat at food with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits (o. pneuma) and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word (o. logos) of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the way side are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word (o. logos) out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word (o. logos) with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, (o. logos) keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told him by certain which said, Your mother and your brethren stand without, desiring to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word (o. logos) of God, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit (o. pneuma) to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to yours own house, and show how great things God has done unto you. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go you and preach the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he spoke this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>And the publican, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but stroke upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be brought low; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; (o. logos) and answer me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed all of you him not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and pleaded him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, (o. logos) that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you says and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt all of you me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they could not take hold of his words (o. rhema) before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, you have well said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>Till I make yours enemies your footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him Lord, how is he then his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>Which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>Then he questioned with him in many words; (o. logos) but he answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>Said unto them, All of you have brought this man unto me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man concerning those things whereof all of you accuse him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breast which never gave suck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>And saying, If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: (o. pneuma) and having said thus, he gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, stroke their breasts, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood far off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek all of you the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but has risen: remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words, (o. rhema)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returned from the tomb, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words (o. rhema) seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said unto them, What manner of communications (o. logos) are these that all of you have one to another, as all of you walk, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word (o. logos) before God and all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of them which were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew nigh unto the village, where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, as he sat at food with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Saying, The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says unto them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said unto them, Why are all of you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit (o. pneuma) has not flesh and bones, as all of you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have all of you here any food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took it, and did eat before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said unto them, These are the words (o. logos) which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it was essential for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And all of you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry all of you in the city of Jerusalem, until all of you be imbued with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
