      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He that strikes Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What will you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they stroke the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>And all of you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; all of you shall throw down their altars: but all of you have not obeyed my voice: why have all of you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Anywhere they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgotten about the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and stroke Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto you. And he arose out of his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>And the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw unto you to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said unto her, If you will go with me, then I will go: but if you will not go with me, then I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for yours honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into yours hand: is not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And the LORD humiliated Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>Nevertheless Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and enquire of you, and say, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and stroke the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>Praise all of you the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>Hear, O all of you kings; give ear, O all of you princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that you will save Israel by mine hand, as you have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so: for he rose up early on the next day, and thrust the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>And Gideon said unto God, Let not yours anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand has saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say unto you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise every one that bows down upon his knees to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into yours hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get you down unto the host; for I have delivered it into yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>But if you fear to go down, go you with Phurah your servant down to the host:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall yours hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and stroke it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall all of you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow all of you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow likewise: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.1'>And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.2'>Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.3'>And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.4'>And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.5'>And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.6'>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.7'>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, all of you men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.8'>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign you over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.9'>But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.10'>And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.11'>But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.12'>Then said the trees unto the vine, Come you, and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.13'>And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.14'>Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.15'>And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth all of you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.16'>Now therefore, if all of you have done truly and sincerely, in that all of you have made Abimelech king, and if all of you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.17'>(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.18'>And all of you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.19'>If all of you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice all of you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.20'>But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.21'>And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.22'>When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.23'>Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.24'>That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.25'>And the men of Shechem set hidden attackers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.26'>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.27'>And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.28'>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.29'>And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase yours army, and come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.30'>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.31'>And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.32'>Now therefore up by night, you and the people that is with you, and lie in wait in the field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.33'>And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.34'>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.35'>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.36'>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.37'>And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.38'>Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now your mouth, wherewith you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.39'>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.40'>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.41'>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.42'>And it came to pass on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.43'>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and stroke them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.44'>And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.45'>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.46'>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.47'>And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.48'>And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What all of you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.49'>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.50'>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.51'>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.52'>And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.53'>And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.54'>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour bearer, and said unto him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.55'>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.56'>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.57'>And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.10'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.1'>And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.2'>And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.3'>And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.4'>And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.5'>And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.6'>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.7'>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.8'>And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.9'>Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.10'>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against you, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.11'>And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.12'>The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and all of you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.13'>Yet all of you have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.14'>Go and cry unto the gods which all of you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.15'>And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do you unto us whatsoever seems good unto you; deliver us only, we pray you, this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.16'>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.17'>Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.18'>And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.11'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.1'>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead brings forth Jephthah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.2'>And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of a strange woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.3'>Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.4'>And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.5'>And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.6'>And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.7'>And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not all of you hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are all of you come unto me now when all of you are in distress?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.8'>And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we return to you now, that you may go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.9'>And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If all of you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.10'>And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.11'>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.12'>And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.13'>And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.14'>And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.15'>And said unto him, Thus says Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.16'>But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.17'>Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.18'>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.19'>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land into my place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.20'>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.21'>And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they stroke them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.22'>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.23'>So now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.24'>Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.25'>And now are you any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.26'>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did all of you not recover them within that time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.27'>Wherefore I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.28'>Nevertheless the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.29'>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.30'>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.31'>Then it shall be, that whatsoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.32'>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.33'>And he stroke them from Aroer, even till you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.34'>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.35'>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.36'>And she said unto him, My father, if you have opened your mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth; forasmuch as the LORD has taken vengeance for you of yours enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.37'>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and mourn for my virginity, I and my fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.38'>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.39'>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.40'>That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.12'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.1'>And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn yours house upon you with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.2'>And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, all of you delivered me not out of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.3'>And when I saw that all of you delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed opposite to the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are all of you come up unto me this day, to fight against me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.4'>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead stroke Ephraim, because they said, All of you Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.5'>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.6'>Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.7'>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.8'>And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.9'>And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.10'>Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.11'>And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.12.12'>And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.</verse>
