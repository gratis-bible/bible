      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence come you? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and turns away from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Have not you made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth yours hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself put not forth yours hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and stroke the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence come you? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and turns away from evil? and still he holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth yours hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in yours hand; but save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and stroke Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself likewise; and he sat down among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his wife unto him, Do you still retain yours integrity? curse God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes far off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job spoke, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a male child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the spirit when I came out of the belly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has come unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If we analyse to commune with you, will you be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Your words have raised up him that was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it has come upon you, and you faint; it touches you, and you are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray you, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Does not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the saints will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>Although affliction comes not out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Which does great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who gives rain upon the earth, and sends waters upon the fields:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He dissapoints the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the perverse is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not you the chastening of the Almighty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He shall deliver you in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he shall redeem you from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine you shall laugh: neither shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you shall be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And you shall know that your tabernacle shall be in peace; and you shall visit your habitation, and shall not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>You shall know also that your seed shall be great, and yours offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of corn comes in in his season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>But Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild ass bray when he has grass? or lows the ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which is unpleasing be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For now all of you are nothing; all of you see my casting down, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are right words! but what does your arguing reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do all of you imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, all of you overwhelm the fatherless, and all of you dig a pit for your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of a worker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as a worker looks for the reward of his work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings back and forth unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.5'>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.8'>The eye of him that has seen me shall see me no more: yours eyes are upon me, and I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.9'>As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away: so he that goes down to the grave shall come up no more.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.27'>He esteems iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.28'>The arrow cannot make him flee: sling stones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.29'>Darts are counted as stubble: he laughs at the shaking of a spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.30'>Sharp stones are under him: he spreads sharp pointed things upon the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.31'>He makes the deep to boil like a pot: he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.32'>He makes a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.33'>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.34'>He beholds all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I plead to you, and I will speak: I will demand of you, and declare you unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye sees you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Wherefore I detest myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for all of you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that all of you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.</verse>
