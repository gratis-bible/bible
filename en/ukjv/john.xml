      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, (o. logos) and the Word (o. logos) was with God, and the Word (o. logos) was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word (o. logos) was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then said they unto him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What says you of yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom all of you know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John sees Jesus coming unto him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit (o. pneuma) descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit (o. pneuma) descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and says unto them, What seek all of you? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He says unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first finds his own brother Simon, and says unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and says unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says unto him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael says unto him, Whence know you me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he says unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter all of you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus says unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus says unto her, Woman, what have I to do with you? mine hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother says unto the servants, Whatsoever he says unto you, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus says unto them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he says unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And says unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things behind; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of yours house has eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign show you unto us, seeing that you do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rear it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word (o. logos) which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus says unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit (o. pneuma) is spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not that I said unto you, All of you must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind (o. pneuma) blows where it decides, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and all of you receive not our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things, and all of you believe not, how shall all of you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>That whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bare witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>All of you yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God has sent speaks the words (o. rhema) of God: for God gives not the Spirit (o. pneuma) by measure unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he must essentially go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says unto her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then says the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman says unto him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then have you that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman says unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus says unto her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, You have well said, I have no husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that said you truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman says unto him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and all of you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus says unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when all of you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>All of you worship all of you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit (o. pneuma) and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is a Spirit: (o. pneuma) and they that worship him must worship him in spirit (o. pneuma) and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman says unto him, I know that Messiah comes, which is called Christ: when he has come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus says unto her, I that speak unto you am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and says to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said unto them, I have food to eat that all of you know not of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus says unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Say not all of you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>And herein is that saying (o. logos) true, One sows, and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that whereon all of you bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and all of you are entered into their labours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying (o. logos) of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his own word; (o. logos)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then said Jesus unto him, Except all of you see signs and wonders, all of you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman says unto him, Sir, come down before my child die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus says unto him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word (o. logos) that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says unto him, Will you be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus says unto him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto you, Take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>And he that was healed know not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things whatsoever he does, these also does the Son likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that all of you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises up the dead, and replenishes life to them; even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word, (o. logos) and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>All of you sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that all of you might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and a shining light: and all of you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. All of you have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And all of you have not his word (o. logos) abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him all of you believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Search the scriptures; for in them all of you think all of you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And all of you will not come to me, that all of you might have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I receive not honour from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that all of you have not the love (o. agape) of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I am come in my Father's name, and all of you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him all of you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can all of you believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that comes from God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom all of you trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For had all of you believed Moses, all of you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if all of you believe not his writings, how shall all of you believe my words? (o. rhema)</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he says unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is truthfully that prophet that should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he says unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(nevertheless there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also went on board ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when came you here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, All of you seek me, not because all of you saw the miracles, but because all of you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Labour not for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him has God the Father sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that all of you believe on him whom he has sent.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said unto you, That all of you also have seen me, and believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he says, I came down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except all of you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, all of you have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoso eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; (o. logos) who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Does this offend you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the spirit that gives life; (o. pneuma) the flesh profits nothing: the words (o. rhema) that I speak unto you, they are spirit, (o. pneuma) and they are life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will all of you also go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words (o. rhema) of eternal life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart behind, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and my Father are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do all of you stone me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, All of you are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them gods, unto whom the word (o. logos) of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I do, though all of you believe not me, believe the works: that all of you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after that says he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things said he: and after that he says unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Nevertheless Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent all of you may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know, that even now, whatsoever you will ask of God, God will give it you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus says unto her, Your brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha says unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She says unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master has come, and calls for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, (o. pneuma) and was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And said, Where have all of you laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take all of you away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, says unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus says unto her, Said I not unto you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus says unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, All of you know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Then from that day forth they took counsel together in order to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think all of you, that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor always all of you have with you; but me all of you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive all of you how all of you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides for ever: and how says you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while all of you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While all of you have light, believe in the light, that all of you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>That the saying (o. logos) of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he that sees me sees him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hear my words, (o. rhema) and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that rejects me, and receives not my words, (o. rhema) has one that judges him: the word (o. logos) that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring all of you against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a villain, we would not have delivered him up unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Then said Pilate unto them, Take all of you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>That the saying (o. logos) of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered him, Says you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Yours own nation and the chief priests have delivered you unto me: what have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said unto him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You says that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate says unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and says unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But all of you have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will all of you therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers intertwined a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they stroke him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate therefore went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that all of you may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate says unto them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Take all of you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, (o. logos) he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then says Pilate unto him, Speak you not unto me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me unto you has the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, (o. logos) he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he says unto his mother, Woman, behold your son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then says he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says true, that all of you might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, wherein was never man yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the tomb was nigh at hand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the tomb, and sees the linen clothes lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>And the cloth, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood without at the tomb weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say unto her, Woman, why weep you? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus says unto her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, says unto him, Sir, if you have borne him behind, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus says unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and says unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus says unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and says unto them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says unto them, Receive all of you the Holy Spirit: (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whomsoever sins all of you remit, they are remitted unto them; and whomsoever sins all of you retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then says he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus says unto him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written, that all of you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing all of you might have life through his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and likewise showed he himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus says unto them, Children, have all of you any food? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and all of you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus says unto them, Bring of the fish which all of you have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus says unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He says to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He says unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Love you me? And he said unto him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus says unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter seeing him says to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus says unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Then went this saying (o. logos) abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</verse>
