And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her adversary also provoked her sore, in order to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why eat you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of yours handmaid, and remember me, and not forget yours handmaid, but will give unto yours handmaid a male child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said unto her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Count not yours handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let yours handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seems you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying unto the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
