But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.

Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman.
