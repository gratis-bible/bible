  <div type='book' osisID='2Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said unto him, From whence come you? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said unto the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said unto me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray you, upon me, and slay me: for anguish has come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here unto my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said unto him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth yours hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he stroke him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said unto him, Your blood be upon your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places: how are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>All of you mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>All of you daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in yours high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been unto me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be all of you of the LORD, that all of you have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because all of you have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be all of you valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: wherefore should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>Nevertheless he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear stroke him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? know you not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore have you gone in unto my father's concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul your father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, All of you sought for David in times past to be king over you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that yours heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came unto you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and stroke him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said unto his servants, Know all of you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they stroke him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they stroke him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul yours enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.10'>And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Came you not from your journey? why then did you not go down unto yours house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set all of you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire all of you from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>And charged the messenger, saying, When you have made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto you, Wherefore approached all of you so nigh unto the city when all of you did fight? knew all of you not that they would shoot from the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who stroke Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went all of you nigh the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And the shooters shot from off the wall upon your servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shall you say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another: make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own food, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the travelling man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus says the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto you such and such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>Wherefore have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from yours house; because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.11'>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of yours own house, and I will take your wives before yours eyes, and give them unto your neighbour, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>And he said unto him, Why are you, being the king's son, lean from day to day? will you not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say unto him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of yours hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>Nevertheless he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>And Absalom spoke unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I plead to you, and his servants go with your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto you. And he pressed him: nevertheless he would not go, but blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark all of you now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Strike Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as your servant said, so it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did reverence, and said, Help, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>And the king said unto her, What disturbs you? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>And the king said unto the woman, Go to yours house, and I will give charge concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>For we must essentially die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>To fetch about this form of speech has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.27'>And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.29'>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.1'>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>And Absalom said unto him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him reverence, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as all of you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all of you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brethren: mercy and truth be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>But if he thus say, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>Unto whom David said, If you pass on with me, then you shall be a burden unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>But if you return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant until now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that whatsoever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them all of you shall send unto me every thing that all of you can hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>And the king said unto Ziba, What mean you by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, yours are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly plead to you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose position you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>And the king said, What have I to do with you, all of you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore have you done so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came out of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side opposite to him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>And I will bring back all the people unto you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in yours own person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>Moreover, if he be got into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cattle, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you help us out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>And the king said unto them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and stroke Absalom, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>And Joab said unto him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came swiftly, and drew near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the gate keeper, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, which has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.33'>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.1'>And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.2'>And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.3'>And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.4'>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.5'>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, which this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.6'>In that you love yours enemies, and hate your friends. For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.7'>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse unto you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.8'>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.9'>And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.10'>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak all of you not a word of bringing the king back?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.11'>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are all of you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.12'>All of you are my brethren, all of you are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are all of you the last to bring back the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.13'>And say all of you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.14'>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return you, and all your servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.15'>So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.16'>And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.17'>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.18'>And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.19'>And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.20'>For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.21'>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.22'>And David said, What have I to do with you, all of you sons of Zeruiah, that all of you should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.23'>Therefore the king said unto Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.24'>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.25'>And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore went not you with me, Mephibosheth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.26'>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.27'>And he has slandered your servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in yours eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.28'>For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you set your servant among them that did eat at yours own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.29'>And the king said unto him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.30'>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king has come again in peace unto his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.31'>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.32'>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.33'>And the king said unto Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will feed you with me in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.34'>And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.35'>I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should your servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.36'>Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.37'>Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.38'>And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto you: and whatsoever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.39'>And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.40'>Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.41'>And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.42'>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be all of you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or has he given us any gift?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.19.43'>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than all of you: why then did all of you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.1'>And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.2'>So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.3'>And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.4'>Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.5'>So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.6'>And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take you your lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.7'>And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.8'>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.9'>And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.10'>But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he stroke him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.11'>And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favours Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.12'>And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.13'>When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.14'>And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.15'>And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.16'>Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.17'>And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Are you Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of yours handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.18'>Then she spoke, saying, They were known to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.19'>I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.20'>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.21'>The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.22'>Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.23'>Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.24'>And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.25'>And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.20.26'>And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.1'>Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.2'>And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.3'>Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that all of you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.4'>And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shall you kill any man in Israel. And he said, What all of you shall say, that will I do for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.5'>And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.6'>Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.7'>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.8'>But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.9'>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.10'>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.11'>And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.12'>And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.13'>And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.14'>And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was implored for the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.15'>Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.16'>And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.17'>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and stroke the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.18'>And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.19'>And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.20'>And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.21'>And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.21.22'>These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.22'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.1'>And David spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.2'>And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.3'>The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; you save me from violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.4'>I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.5'>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.6'>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.7'>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.8'>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.9'>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.10'>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.11'>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.12'>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.13'>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.14'>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.15'>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and humiliated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.16'>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.17'>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.18'>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.38'>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.39'>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.40'>For you have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you subdued under me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.41'>You have also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.42'>They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.43'>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.44'>You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.45'>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.46'>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.47'>The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.48'>It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.49'>And that brings me forth from mine enemies: you also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.50'>Therefore I will give thanks unto you, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.51'>He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He arose, and stroke the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: nevertheless he attained not unto the first three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number all of you the people, that I may know the number of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD your God add unto the people, no matter how many they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>And David's heart stroke him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I plead to you, O LORD, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go and say unto David, Thus says the LORD, I offer you three things; choose you one of them, that I may do it unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto you in your land? or will you flee three months before yours enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.15'>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now yours hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that stroke the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let yours hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD your God accept you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was implored for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</verse>
