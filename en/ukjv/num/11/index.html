and wherefore have I not found favour in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say unto me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the nursing infant, unto the land which you sware unto their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, instantly, if I have found favour in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon you, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say you unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and all of you shall eat flesh: for all of you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and all of you shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All of you shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that all of you have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? you shall see now whether my word shall come to pass unto you or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said unto him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD stroke the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
