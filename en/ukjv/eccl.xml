      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit has a man of all his labour which he takes under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth abides for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hastes to his place where he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind goes toward the south, and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to his circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>The thing that has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it has been already of old time, which was before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have got more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove you with delight, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter, It is mad: and of delight, What does it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that brings forth trees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the exclusive treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has been already done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise man? as the fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what has man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he has laboured under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit has he that works in that wherein he labours?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the travail, which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He has made every thing beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that, whatsoever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God requires that which is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>Yea, better is he than either of them, which has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither says he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls; for he has not another to help him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For out of prison he comes to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becomes poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his position.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Keep your foot when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Be not rash with your mouth, and let not yours heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and you upon earth: therefore let your words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When you vow a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools: pay that which you have vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Suffer not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; neither say you before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of yours hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear you God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with increase: this is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he bring forths a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came out of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit has he that has laboured for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>All his days also he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him: for it is his portion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answers him in the joy of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>A man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wants nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eats it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man brought forth an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For he comes in with vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this has more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet has he seen no good: do not all go to one place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what has the wise more than the fool? what has the poor, that knows to walk before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>That which has been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.6'>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>Surely oppression makes a wise man mad; and a gift destroys the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not enquire wisely concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to them that have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has set the one opposite to the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Be not over much wicked, neither be you foolish: why should you die before your time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>It is good that you should take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not yours hand: for he that fears God shall come out of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.19'>Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.20'>For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.21'>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>For oftentimes also yours own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>Behold, this have I found, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>Which yet my soul seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>Lo, this only have I found, that God has made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who is as the wise man? and who knows the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom makes his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I counsel you to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he does whatsoever pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What do you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>Whoso keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither has he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man rules over another to his own hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he fears not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then I commended delight, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>In order to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God now accepts your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of the life of your vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity: for that is your portion in this life, and in your labour which you take under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rules among fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroys much good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so does a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Yea also, when he that is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails him, and he says to every one that he is a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whoso removes stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaves wood shall be endangered thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the iron be blunt, and he do not sharpen the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The labour of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answers all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.11'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast your bread upon the waters: for you shall find it after many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil shall be upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.4'>He that observes the wind shall not sow; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>As you know not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so you know not the works of God who makes all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.6'>In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not yours hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.7'>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.8'>But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.9'>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of yours heart, and in the sight of yours eyes: but know you, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.10'>Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.12'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.1'>Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.2'>While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.3'>In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.4'>And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.5'>Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.6'>Before even the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.7'>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.8'>Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.9'>And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.10'>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.11'>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.12'>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.13'>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.12.14'>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</verse>
