  <div type='book' osisID='Deut'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These be the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite to the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, All of you have dwelt long enough in this mount:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, all of you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as all of you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And all of you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>All of you shall not respect persons in judgment; but all of you shall hear the small as well as the great; all of you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things which all of you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which all of you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said unto you, All of you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said unto you; fear not, neither be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And all of you came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Notwithstanding all of you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>And all of you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Where shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The LORD your God which goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bare you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that all of you went, until all of you came into this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in this thing all of you did not believe the LORD your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way all of you should go, and in a cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, which all of you said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then all of you answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when all of you had girded on every man his weapons of war, all of you were ready to go up into the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest all of you be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke unto you; and all of you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And all of you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So all of you abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that all of you abode there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>All of you have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command you the people, saying, All of you are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take all of you good heed unto yourselves therefore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>All of you shall buy food of them for money, that all of you may eat; and all of you shall also buy water of them for money, that all of you may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the works of your hand: he knows your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horims also dwelt in Seir in time past; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their position; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>That the LORD spoke unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>You are to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And when you come nigh opposite to the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their position:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their position even unto this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their position.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise all of you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into yours hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we stroke him, and his sons, and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do unto him as you did unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we stroke him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside towns without protective walls a great many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: all of you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that all of you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond Jordan: and then shall all of you return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Yours eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms where you pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>All of you shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice you; speak no more unto me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up yours eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with yours eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we abode in the valley opposite to Bethpeor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, in order to do them, that all of you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>All of you shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall all of you diminish ought from it, that all of you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>But all of you that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.5'>Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that all of you should do so in the land where all of you go to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.6'>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.7'>Remember, and forget not, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you did depart out of the land of Egypt, until all of you came unto this place, all of you have been rebellious against the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.8'>Also in Horeb all of you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.9'>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.12'>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get you down quickly from behind; for your people which you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.13'>Furthermore the LORD spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stubborn people:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.20'>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>And I took your sin, the calf which all of you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, all of you provoked the LORD to wrath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.9.25'>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.26'>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and yours inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.27'>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.28'>Lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</verse>
