      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire setting itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Anywhere the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up opposite to them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up opposite to them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>For they are shameless children and stiff hearted. I do send you unto them; and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And you shall speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But you, son of man, hear what I say unto you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get you unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have hearkened unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto you; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are shameless and hardhearted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto you receive in yours heart, and hear with yours ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get you to them of the captivity, unto the children of your people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels opposite to them, and a noise of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made you a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, When a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut yourself within yours house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and illustrate upon it the city, even Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Moreover take you unto you an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Lie you also upon your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie upon it you shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have laid upon you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and yours arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I will lay bands upon you, and you shall not turn you from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Take you also unto you wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make you bread thereof, according to the number of the days that you shall lie upon your side, three hundred and ninety days shall you eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>You shall drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shall you drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And you shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it with dung that comes out of man, in their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>That they may lack bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon yours head and upon your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>You shall burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and you shall take a third part, and strike about it with a knife: and a third part you shall scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>You shall also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus says the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because all of you multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against you, and will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in you that which I have not done, and unto which I will not do any more the like, because of all yours abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Wherefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD; Surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all yours abominations, therefore will I also diminish you; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make you waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about you, when I shall execute judgments in you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you: and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>And say, All of you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet will I leave a remnant, that all of you may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when all of you shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus says the Lord GOD; Strike with yours hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>Then shall all of you know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>Also, you son of man, thus says the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end has come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up yours eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD sees us not; the LORD has forsaken the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Then he said unto me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's ink holder by his side;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go all of you after him through the city, and strike: let not your eye spare, neither have all of you pity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go all of you forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your fury upon Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD has forsaken the earth, and the LORD sees not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.38'>And I will judge you, as women that violate marriage bond and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.23'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.13'>Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.16'>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.17'>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.18'>So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like my mind was alienated from her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.20'>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.21'>Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, in bruising your teats by the Egyptians for the breast of your youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.22'>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your mind is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.23'>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.24'>And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.25'>And I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you: they shall take away your nose and yours ears; and your remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.26'>They shall also strip you out of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.27'>Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that you shall not lift up yours eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.28'>For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your mind is alienated:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.29'>And they shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all your labour, and shall leave you naked and bare: and the nakedness of your whoredoms shall be discovered, both your lewdness and your whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>I will do these things unto you, because you have gone a whoring after the heathen, and because you are polluted with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus says the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>You shall even drink it and suck it out, and you shall break the earthen ware thereof, and pluck off yours own breasts: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, will you judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>And furthermore, that all of you have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom you did wash yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>And sat upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you have set mine incense and mine oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that plays the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus says the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.49'>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and all of you shall bear the sins of your idols: and all of you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.1'>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.2'>Son of man, write you the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.3'>And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</verse>
