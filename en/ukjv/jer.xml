      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet unto the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for you shall go to all that I shall send you, and whatsoever I command you you shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then said the LORD unto me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command you: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, behold, I have made you this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you, says the LORD, to deliver you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of yours espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear all of you the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus says the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when all of you entered, all of you defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, says the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be astonished, O all of you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be all of you very desolate, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Is Israel a servant? is he a native slave? why is he spoiled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Have you not procured this unto yourself, in that you have forsaken the LORD your God, when he led you by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Yours own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though you wash you with alkali, and take you much soap, yet yours iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Wherefore will all of you plead with me? all of you all have transgressed against me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation, see all of you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>Why trim you your way to seek love? therefore have you also taught the wicked ones your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocent persons: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Yet you says, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you says, I have not sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>Why arm you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Yea, you shall go forth from him, and yours hands upon yours head: for the LORD has rejected your confidences, and you shall not prosper in them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up yours eyes unto the high places, and see where you have not been lien with. In the ways have you sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your whoredoms and with your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Will you not from this time cry unto me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done evil things as you could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>And it came to pass through the levity of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge yours iniquity, that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and all of you have not obeyed my voice, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Turn, O backsliding children, says the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass, when all of you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have all of you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return, all of you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto you; for you are the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>For shame has devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If you will return, O Israel, says the LORD, return unto me: and if you will put away yours abominations out of my sight, then shall you not remove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>And you shall swear, The LORD lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, all of you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare all of you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow all of you the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make your land desolate; and your cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass at that day, says the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, All of you shall have peace; whereas the sword reachs unto the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, wash yours heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes affliction from mount Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Make all of you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she has been rebellious against me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Your way and your doings have procured these things unto you; this is your wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reachs unto yours heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are foolish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And when you are spoiled, what will you do? Though you cloth yourself with crimson, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you rent your face with painting, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewails herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run all of you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if all of you can find a man, if there be any that executes judgment, that seeks the truth; and I will pardon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>And though they say, The LORD lives; surely they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O LORD, are not yours eyes upon the truth? you have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.7'>How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.3'>For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.4'>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.5'>They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must essentially be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.6'>Forasmuch as there is none like unto you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.7'>Who would not fear you, O King of nations? in order to you does it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.8'>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.9'>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.10'>But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.11'>Thus shall all of you say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.12'>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.13'>When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.14'>Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.16'>The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.10.18'>For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.19'>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.20'>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone out of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.21'>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.22'>Behold, the noise of the bruit has come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.23'>O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.24'>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in yours anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.10.25'>Pour out your fury upon the heathen that know you not, and upon the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore do you prophesy, and say, Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says the LORD: though all of you fight with the Chaldeans, all of you shall not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum yours uncle shall come unto you saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.8'>So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.14'>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.15'>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.16'>Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.17'>Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.18'>You show loving kindness unto thousands, and recompence the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.20'>Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and have made you a name, as at this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.21'>And have brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.22'>And have given them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.23'>And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commandedst them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken has come to pass; and, behold, you see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>And you have said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy you the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.28'>Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.29'>And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.30'>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>For this city has been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>And now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof all of you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.38'>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.39'>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.40'>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.41'>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.42'>For thus says the LORD; Like I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.43'>And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof all of you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.44'>Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, says the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.19'>The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.20'>You are my battle axe and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.27'>Set all of you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.28'>Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.29'>And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might has failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwelling places; her bars are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at every quarter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.32'>And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.34'>Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon, he has filled his belly with my delicates, he has cast me out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.35'>The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.36'>Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.37'>And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.38'>They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.39'>In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.40'>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.41'>How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.42'>The sea has come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.43'>Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.44'>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.45'>My people, go all of you out of the midst of her, and deliver all of you every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.46'>And lest your heart faint, and all of you fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.47'>Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.48'>Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.49'>As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.50'>All of you that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD far off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.51'>We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame has covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.52'>Wherefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.53'>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.54'>A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.55'>Because the LORD has spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.56'>Because the spoiler has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.57'>And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.58'>Thus says the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.59'>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.60'>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.61'>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, and shall see, and shall read all these words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.62'>Then shall you say, O LORD, you have spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.63'>And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.64'>And you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the basons, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fastener of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon stroke them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
