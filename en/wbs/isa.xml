      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom; we should have been like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mount of the LORD'S house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he will judge among the nations, and will rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east, and are sooth-sayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be abased, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And upon every high tower, and upon every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be abased, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols he will utterly abolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the rod and the staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the skillful artificer, and the eloquent orator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe to their soul! for they have rewarded evil to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they who lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and with their princes: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with extended necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the show of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>The rings, and nose-jewels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be an offensive odor; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate, shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that have escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-press therein: and he expected that it would bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What more could have been done to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected that it would bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now come; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there is no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In my ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to them that rise early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflameth them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people have gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart-rope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe to them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills trembled, and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yes, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one looketh to the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in its heavens.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and elevated, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above it stood seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>And the LORD shall have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up towards Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'>Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'>And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'>Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'>Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'>Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'>Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the hight above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David? Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'>Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'>The LORD will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'>In the same day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'>And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'>With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'>And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'>Moreover, the LORD said to me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.2'>And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'>And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'>The LORD spoke also to me again, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'>Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'>Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'>And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the extension of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'>Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'>Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'>For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'>Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'>Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'>And he will be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'>And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be insnared, and be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'>And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'>And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'>And they shall pass through it, distressed and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'>And they shall look to the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.9'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.1'>Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her distress, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.2'>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shades of death, upon them hath the light shined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.3'>Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.4'>For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.5'>For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.6'>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'>Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'>And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.10'>The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.11'>Therefore the LORD will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.12'>The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.13'>For the people turn not to him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.14'>Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.15'>The ancient and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.16'>For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led by them are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.17'>Therefore the Lord will have no joy in their young men, neither will have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.18'>For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the rising of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.19'>Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.20'>And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.21'>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.10'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.1'>Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.2'>To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.3'>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.4'>Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.5'>O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.6'>I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.7'>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.8'>For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.9'>Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.10'>As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images excelled them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.11'>Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.12'>Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.13'>For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.14'>And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.15'>Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth with it? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it, or as if the staff should lift itself, as if it were no wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.16'>Therefore will the Lord, the LORD of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he will kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.17'>And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.18'>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.19'>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.20'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as have escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them; but shall lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.21'>The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.22'>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.23'>For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.24'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.25'>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.26'>And the LORD of hosts will raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.27'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.32'>As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
