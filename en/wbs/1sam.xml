      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none besides thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, No; but thou shalt give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband, to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee issue of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy heart: and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my Anointed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house, shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest's offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, that he could not see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD: and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide any thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: acquit yourselves like men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way-side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law, and her husband were dead, she bowed herself, and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory hath departed from Israel. (Because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, The glory hath departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD: and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshhold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshhold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod, and its borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is severe upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>They sent therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?

        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.7'>And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>And they said to the messengers that came, thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>And it was so on the morrow, that Saul disposed the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning-watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they who remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to-day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal: and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.1'>And Samuel said to all Israel, behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.7'>Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.8'>When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers from Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.11'>And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.12'>And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.13'>Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines: and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed) then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled at Michmash;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>Therefore said I, the Philistines will now come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leadeth to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: (for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.20'>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his colter, and his ax, and his mattock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the colters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>The front of the one was situated northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to these men, and we will discover ourselves to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be a sign to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor-bearer slew after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half-acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.18'>And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on, and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the country around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Beth-aven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And when the people had come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honey-comb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.31'>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon: and the people were very faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.34'>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.36'>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.37'>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.38'>And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.39'>For as the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.40'>Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.43'>Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, lo, I must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.44'>And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.45'>And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.47'>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he harassed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.48'>And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.49'>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.50'>And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.51'>And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.52'>And there was violent war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.1'>Samuel also said to Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>And Saul assembled the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.5'>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.6'>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.10'>Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.11'>I repent that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.18'>And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.19'>Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.20'>And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.21'>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.22'>And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.25'>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.29'>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.30'>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.31'>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.32'>Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.33'>And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.34'>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.35'>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.1'>And the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.13'>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.14'>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.19'>Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who is with the sheep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.1'>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.2'>But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now, therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.3'>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.4'>And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been toward thee very good:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>For he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: Why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away from Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou dost not save thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goat's hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.16'>And when the messengers had come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goat's hair for his bolster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.17'>And Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>Then he went also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said to him, Far be it from thee; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing, either great or small, but that he will show it to me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he should be grieved: But truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new-moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If thy father shall at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me, that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he shall say thus, It is well; thy servant will have peace: but if he shall be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there is in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldst thou bring me to thy father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father shall answer thee roughly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to-morrow any time, or the third day, and behold, if there be good towards David, and I then send not to thee, and show it thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it shall please my father to do thee evil, then I will show it to thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>And thou shalt, not only while yet I live, show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>But also thou shalt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to David, To-morrow is the new-moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new-moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why cometh not the son of Jesse to eat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother he hath commanded me to be there: and now if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not to the king's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow, beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>And Jonathan gave his arms to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place towards the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.\</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.43'>\20:42\And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.2'>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or what there is present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the show-bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.14'>Then said Achish to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: why then have ye brought him to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.15'>Have I need of mad-men, that ye have brought this man to play the mad-man in my presence? shall this man come into my house?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.1'>David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.2'>And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, resorted to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.3'>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.4'>And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.5'>And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.6'>When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.7'>Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.8'>That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth to me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.9'>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.10'>And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.11'>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.12'>And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.13'>And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.14'>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thy house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.15'>Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me. Let not the king impute any thing to his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.16'>And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.17'>And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.18'>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that wore a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.19'>And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.20'>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.21'>And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.22'>And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.23'>Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.1'>Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.2'>Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.3'>And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.4'>Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.5'>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.6'>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.7'>And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.8'>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.9'>And David knew that Saul secretly plotted mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.10'>Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.11'>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.12'>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.13'>Then David and his men who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah: and he forbore to go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.15'>And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.16'>And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.17'>And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.18'>And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.19'>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.20'>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.7'>And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thy eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatever cometh to thy hand, to thy servants, and to thy son David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David, according to all these words, and ceased.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men, whom I know not whence they are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all these sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withheld thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thy own hand, now let thy enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>And now this blessing which thy handmaid hath brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>Yet a man hath risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thy enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the middle of a sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>And it will come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>That this will be no grief to thee, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, who hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and said to her, Return in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had left Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>And when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to him for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.41'>And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had come in very deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>Then answered David, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thy enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed and be guiltless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD will smite him; or his day will come to die; or he will descend into battle and perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>Then said the woman, whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said to her be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God hath departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>Then said Samuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD hath departed from thee, and hath become thy enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And the LORD hath done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because thou didst not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing to thee this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>Moreover, the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was exceedingly afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words, which thou didst speak</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fat calf in the house: and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this man return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he should be an adversary to us: for with what would he reconcile himself to his master? would it not be with the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Is not this David, of whom they sung one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant, so long as I have been with thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Wherefore now rise early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye shall have risen early in the morning, and have light, depart.</verse>
