      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the setting of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan towards the sun-rising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us, we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel, to search out the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house: for they have come to search out all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not whence they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it came to pass about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went, I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned: and afterward ye may go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household home to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be quit of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to-morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>And as they that bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down towards the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had passed quite over Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take you twelve men from the people, from every tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of Jordan, as the the LORD commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up upon the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted; neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you: Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou standest is holy: and Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was closely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, and the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round the city once: thus shalt thou do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend every man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear-guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed from your mouth, until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear-guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are in it, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even to this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will environ us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; Why liest thou thus upon thy face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to their families: and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.15'>And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>And he brought his household man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>And thou shalt do to Ai and her king, as thou didst to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>Then ye shall rise from the ambush and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>And he took about five thousand men; and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain: but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>And there was not a man left in Ai, or Beth-el that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand towards Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand towards the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>For Joshua drew not his hand back with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise upon it a great heap of stones, that remaineth to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up any iron: and they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark, and on that side, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.1'>Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men of it were mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, assembled themselves, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains, are assembled against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.10'>And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.11'>And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel, and were in the descent to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.16'>But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.17'>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.23'>And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.24'>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.17'>For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us, and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now therefore put away (said he) the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us, it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.30'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.31'>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.32'>And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.33'>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</verse>
