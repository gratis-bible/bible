      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) who is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the free-will-offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then arose the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.11'>All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring with them of the captivity that were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people assembled themselves as one man at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt-offerings on it to the LORD, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>And afterward offered the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will-offering to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and provisions, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, who brought us up hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions to Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dianites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side of the river, and at such a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him, even to Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the noxious city, and have set up its walls, and joined the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up again, then they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so wilt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We certify the king that, if this city shall be built again, and its walls set up, by this means thou wilt have no portion on this side of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side of the river, sent to Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus; To Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth rapidly, and prospereth in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to erect these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was erected these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>Now therefore, if it seemeth good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.3'>In the first year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the hight of it sixty cubits, and the breadth of it sixty cubits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.4'>With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:</verse>
