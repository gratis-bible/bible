But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, In what have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where are now your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the baker's street, until all the bread in the city should be consumed. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
