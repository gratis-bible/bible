      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Wherefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunamite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah, helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah slew sheep, and oxen, and fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Wherefore Nathan spoke to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go, and enter in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while thou art yet talking there with the king, I will also come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bath-sheba went to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite ministered to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldst thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown it to thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come from thence rejoicing, so that the city resounded. This is the noise that ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and went every man his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to-day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do to him; but his hoary head do thou bring down to the grave with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? and he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunamite for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bath-sheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunamite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, to wit, Abner the son of Ner captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the room of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence to any place whatever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For it shall be, that on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath: and they told Shimei, saying, behold, thy servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD will return thy wickedness upon thy own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies: but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.12'>And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor have they been seen to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.13'>And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.18'>Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.19'>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.27'>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.28'>And Solomon had horses brought from Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.29'>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.5'>And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: it may be we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.6'>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.13'>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt-sacrifice, and on the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>And the water ran around the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.7'>And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.10'>And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife instigated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah, spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith to me, that will I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And the LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets? And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this man in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micaiah said, If thou shalt return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:\</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>\22:43\nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>\22:44\And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>\22:45\Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>\22:46\And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed from the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>\22:47\There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>\22:48\Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>\22:49\Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>\22:50\And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>\22:51\Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>\22:52\And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.54'>\22:53\For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</verse>
