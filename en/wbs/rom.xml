      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>And declared to be the Son of God, with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>Making request (if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God) to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you (but have been hitherto hindered) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians, both to the wise, and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in this is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them; for God hath shown it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause God gave them up to vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Who, knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death; not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest, doest the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them who commit such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality; eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness; indignation and wrath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing testimony, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one another)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keepest the law; but if thou art a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore, if the uncircumcision keepeth the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfilleth the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some did not believe? will their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>By no means: verily let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>By no means: for then how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And not rather (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery are in their ways:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And the way of peace have they not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever things the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being testified by the law and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he may be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No; but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make void the law through faith? By no means: but we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we then say that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they are not circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before him whom he believed, even God, who reviveth the dead, and calleth those things which are not, as though they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who against hope believed with hope, that he should become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And being fully persuaded, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>But for us also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>Who was delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we also joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>That as sin hath reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>By no means: how shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants in obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, to (work) iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness, to (work) holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now being made free from sin, and having become servants to God, ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman who hath a husband, is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband is dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then, if while her husband liveth, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband is dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead by which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And the commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Was then that which is good made death to me? By no means. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they that are according to the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh: but they that are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. Now if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>But if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised Christ from the dead will also revive your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit itself testifieth with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with him, that we may be glorified together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we are saved by hope: But hope that is seen, is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we see not, then with patience we wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who will lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, or rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>Nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them who fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou shalt continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be ingrafted: for God is able to ingraft them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if thou wast cut out of the olive-tree which is wild by nature, and wast ingrafted contrary to nature into a good olive-tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part hath happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles shall be come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For from him, and by him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For through the grace given to me, I say, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing earnest in prayer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless them who persecute you; bless, and curse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Be of the same mind one towards another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If it is possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore if thy enemy hungereth, feed him; if he thirsteth, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but from God: the powers that are, are ordained by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Whoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power; do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou doest that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For, for this cause ye pay tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there is any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love worketh no ill to one's neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the lusts of flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him who eateth not, judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth: and he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord: and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean by itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if thy brother is grieved with thy food, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy food, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>For the sake of food, destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing by which thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>And he that doubteth is damned if he eateth, because he eateth not from faith: for whatever is not from faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For whatever things were written formerly, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another according to Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again Isaiah saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>And I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have therefore cause for glorying through Jesus Christ, in those things which pertain to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>And so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>But as it is written, They shall see to whom he was not spoken of: and they that have not heard shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I shall be somewhat filled with your company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>That I may be delivered from them in Judea who do not believe; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</verse>
