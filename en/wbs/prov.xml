        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they shalt be an ornament of grace to thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; who taketh away the life of its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and rejected my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever hearkeneth to me shall dwell in safety, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>So that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yes, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; and every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger who flattereth with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>Who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house inclineth to death, and her paths to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None that go to her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of it than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>These six things doth the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.17'>A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.18'>A heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>A false witness that speaketh lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.20'>My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.23'>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.24'>To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.25'>Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.26'>For by means of a lewd woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</verse>
