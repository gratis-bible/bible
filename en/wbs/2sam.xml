      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>It came even to pass on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>And David said to him, From whence comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel have I escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen, and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan thou wast slain in thy high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been to me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years: but the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the time that David was king in Hebron, over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then there arose, and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, who pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side: so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And there was a very severe battle that day; and Abner was defeated, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take to thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: Why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>But he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>Joab also, and Abishai pursued Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou wilt bid the people return from following their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had assembled all the people, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and sixty men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, who against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to-day with a fault concerning this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou shalt first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver to me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her, weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to David in Hebron, and twenty men with him: and David made Abner and the men that were with him, a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Joab and all the host that was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he hath gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going-out and thy coming-in, and to know all that thou doest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, If I taste bread or aught else, till the sun is down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as what ever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there hath a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. The LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (For Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet: he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went away through the plain all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, (thinking to have brought good tidings,) I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.4'>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.8'>And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.9'>But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.10'>And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down to thy house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk: and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the front of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>And if the king's wrath shall rise, and he shall say to thee, Why approached ye so nigh to the city for the fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants: and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>The rich man had very numerous flocks and herds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>But the poor man had nothing save one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nourished: and it grew up together with him, and with his children: it fed of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the way-faring man that had come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>And he shall restore the lamb four-fold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to thee such and such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.11'>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes, and give them to thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.12'>For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.13'>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.14'>But, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to thee shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.15'>And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.16'>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how will he then be grieved, if we tell him that the child is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but after the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted, and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>But now he is dead, Why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.25'>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.26'>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.27'>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.28'>Now therefore collect the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>And David collected all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>And Amnon was so afflicted, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>And he said to him, Why art thou, being the king's son, pining from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down and made himself sick: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make for me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress meat for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>Howbeit, he would not hearken to her voice: but being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>And she had a garment of divers colors upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to thee. And he pressed him: yet he would not go, but blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Absalom pressed him that he should let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have I not commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man rode upon his mule, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that information came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come; as thy servant said, so it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was towards Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>And Joab sent to Tekoah, and brought thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>And come to the king, and speak in this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.6'>And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.7'>And behold, the whole family hath risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they will quench my coal which is left, and will not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>And the king said, Whoever saith aught to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.13'>And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king doth not bring home again his banished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>Now therefore that I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>Then thy handmaid said, The word of my lord the king, will now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.18'>Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>To bring about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.21'>And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.22'>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.23'>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.24'>And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.25'>But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.26'>And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.27'>And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.28'>So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.29'>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, that he might send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.31'>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom, to his house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.32'>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me had I been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.1'>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>And the king said to him, Go in peace, So he arose, and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he should overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall appoint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women who were concubines to keep the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>And all his servants passed on by his side; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may; return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>But if he shall thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>The king said also to Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until word shall come from you to certify me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>And it came to pass, that when David had come to the top of the mount, where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>To whom David said, If thou shalt pass on with me, then thou wilt be a burden to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>But if thou shalt return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that whatever thing thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.36'>Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send to me every thing that ye can hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjaminite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>And I will bring back all the people to thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>And the saying, pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>And when Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given, is not good at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they who are with him are valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>Therefore I counsel that all Israel should be generally gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou shouldst go to battle in thy own person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>Moreover, if he shall have entered into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; into which they descended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn upon it; and the thing was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, they have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that had not gone over Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died. and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra, an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>And it came to pass, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>And David numbered the people that were with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou shouldst succor us out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>And the king said to them, What seemeth to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was suspended between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel: for Joab restrained the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and raised for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and inform the king, how the LORD hath avenged himself of his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But however, let me also, I pray thee, run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>But however, said he, let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>And the watchman called, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.26'>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.27'>And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.28'>And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that raised their hand against my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.29'>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.30'>And the king said to him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.31'>And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.32'>And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.33'>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.39'>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they have fallen under my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.40'>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.41'>Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.42'>They looked, but there was none to save; even to the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.43'>Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I stamped them as the mire of the street, and spread them abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.44'>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.45'>Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.46'>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall tremble from their close places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.47'>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.48'>It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.49'>And that bringeth me forth from my enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.50'>Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.22.51'>He is the tower of salvation for his king: and he showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Although my house is not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he maketh it not to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there assembled to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand adhered to the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were collected into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>And David was then in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: yet he attained not to the first three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion-like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.24'>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD thy God add to the people, how many soever they may be, a hundred-fold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and towards Jazer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Joab presented the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>For when David had risen in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>Go and say to David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now consider, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.15'>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him: And Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good to him: behold, here are oxen for burnt-sacrifice, and threshing-instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt-offerings to the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</verse>
