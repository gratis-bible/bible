for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after those days we took up our furniture, and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There went with us also certain of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the day following Paul went in with us to James: and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they are informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying, That they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do therefore this that we say to thee: we have four men who have a vow on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take them, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an offering should be offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews who were from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Crying out, Men of Israel, help. This is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further, hath brought Greeks also into the temple; and hath polluted this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For they had seen before with him in the city, Trophimus, an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple. And forthwith the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the chief captain came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains: and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne by the soldiers, for the violence of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a man who am a Jew of Tarsus, a city of Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made entire silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
