and why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father beareth the sucking child, to the land which thou sworest to their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if thou dealest thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou mayest not bear it thyself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But even a whole month, until it shall come out at your nostrils, and it be lothsome to you; because ye have despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said, The people among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD'S hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass to thee, or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that when the spirit rested upon them; they prophesied, and did not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were described, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord, Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? I would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth: and abode at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
