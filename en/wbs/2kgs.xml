      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why have ye now returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold ye your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold ye your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets who were to view at Jericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the ground barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from thence to Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald-head; go up, thou bald-head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless, he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look towards thee, nor see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat-offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirhara-seth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about it, and smote it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son that was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: And they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD: and the creditor hath come to take to him my two sons to be bond-men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the remainder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a distinguished woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passeth by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunamite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And when the child was grown, it happened on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new-moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunamite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child? and she answered, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is sorrowful within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: and if thou shalt meet any man, salute him not; and if any shall salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunamite. So he called her. And when she had come in to him, he said, Take up thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.2'>And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.3'>Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.4'>So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.5'>And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.6'>And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.7'>And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.8'>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.9'>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.10'>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.11'>Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? Why came this mad man to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.12'>And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.13'>Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.14'>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.15'>But king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your minds, then let none go forth nor escape from the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.16'>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.17'>And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.18'>So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he doth not return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.19'>Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.20'>And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and doth not return? and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.21'>And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.22'>And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the lewd acts of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.23'>And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.24'>And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.25'>Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.26'>Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.27'>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.28'>And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.29'>And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.30'>And when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and adorned her head, and looked out at a window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.31'>And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.32'>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.33'>And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.34'>And when he had come in, he ate, and drank, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.35'>And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.36'>Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.37'>And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.1'>And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.3'>Look out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.4'>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.5'>And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thy eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.6'>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, if ye are mine, and if ye will hearken to my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king's sons being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.7'>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.9'>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.10'>Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD hath done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.</verse>

If it is, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.16'>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.18'>And Jehu convened all the people, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.19'>Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal: whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.20'>And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.21'>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.24'>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.25'>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.26'>And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.27'>And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.28'>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.31'>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.32'>In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.13'>And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.14'>And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.15'>And the fire-pans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.16'>The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.17'>The hight of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was brass: and the hight of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the capital around, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.18'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.19'>And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.20'>And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.21'>And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.22'>And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.23'>And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of Maachathite, they and their men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.24'>And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.25'>But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.26'>And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.27'>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.28'>And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.29'>And changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.25.30'>And his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</verse>
