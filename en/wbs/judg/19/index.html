And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the man arose to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the man would not tarry that night, but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his master said to him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who was also of mount Ephraim; and he dwelt in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjaminites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a way-faring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be with thee; however, let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet and ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house on all sides, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And her lord rose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshhold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, Rise, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man rose, and went to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it was so, that all that saw it, said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
