Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up by lot against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the children of Benjamin assembled out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a hair-breadth, and not miss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the children of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the children of Benjamin came forth from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?

And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Israel set liers in wait around Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe: but they knew not that evil was near them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke to rise from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But when the flame began to rise from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thus they inclosed the Benjaminites on all sides, and chased them, and trod them down with ease over against Gibeah towards the sun-rising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
