      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>Children in whom was no blemish, but of good appearance, and skillful in all wisdom, and intelligent in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end of them they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your provision and your drink: for why should he see your faces more meager than the children who are of your sort? then will ye make me endanger my head to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the children that eat of the portion of the king's provision: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king's provision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times superior to all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dream. So they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriac, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation of it, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye shall show the dream, and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if ye will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that hath asked such things of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known to us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went into Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the sooth-sayers, cannot show to the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and its form was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>The head of this image was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain, without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose hight was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to convene the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sherifs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were assembled to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whoever shall not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>And whoever shall not fall down and worship, that he shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do ye not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their coats, their hose, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counselors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt: and the form of the fourth is like the son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth from the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counselors, being assembled, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought towards me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the sooth-sayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its hight was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and its hight reached to heaven, and the sight of it to the end of all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shade under it, and the fowls of heaven dwelt among its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts escape from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation of it, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation of it, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered, and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thy enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose hight reached to the heaven, and the sight of it to all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit of it abundant, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of heaven had their habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth to heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times shall pass over him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure to thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom hath departed from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What doest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagles' wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>Therefore the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the pleasant land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it grew great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</verse>
