The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>\6:13\Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>\6:14\Then the king, when he heard these words, was much displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the setting of the sun to deliver him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>\6:15\Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>\6:16\Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>\6:17\And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>\6:18\Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\6:19\Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\6:20\And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\6:21\Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\6:22\My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\6:23\Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\6:24\And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\6:25\Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>\6:26\I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>\6:27\He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>\6:28\So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
