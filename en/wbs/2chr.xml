      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon: for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But the ark of God David had brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shown great mercy to David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy great people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so they brought out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in it, even so deal with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual show-bread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then that I should build him a house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Send me now therefore a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that hath skill to grave with the skillful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderfully great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that may build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord hath spoken of, let him send to his servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou mayest convey it to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set seventy thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these are the things in which Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the hight was a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm trees and chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the most holy house, the length of which was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he erected the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the hight of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the hight of it; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And under it was the similitude of oxen, which encompassed it: ten in a cubit, encompassing the sea. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And the thickness of it was a hand-breadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were upon the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>He made also bases, and lavers he made upon the bases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be ascertained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which the show-bread was set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, he put among the treasures of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark, and the staffs of it above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And they drew out the staffs of the ark, that the ends of the staffs were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put in it at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>Also the Levites who were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren; being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>Since the day that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken; for I am raised up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And in it have I put the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>(For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor on the earth; who keepest covenant, and showest mercy to thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>Thou who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and hast spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>That thy eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which thou hast said, that thou wouldst put thy name there; to hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth towards this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>Hearken therefore to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make towards this place: hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath shall come before thy altar in this house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>And if thy people Israel shall be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.2'>And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.3'>With twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Cushites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.4'>And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.5'>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were assembled at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.6'>Upon which the princes of Israel, and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.7'>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.8'>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>Instead of which, king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.11'>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and conveyed them, and brought them again into the guard-chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.12'>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.13'>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.14'>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.15'>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.16'>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.1'>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.2'>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.4'>And Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.5'>Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.6'>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David, hath risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.7'>And there are gathered to him vain men, the children of Belial, and they have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.8'>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made for you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister to the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.11'>And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt-sacrifices and sweet incense: the show-bread also they set in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its lamps to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>And behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye will not prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.14'>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.15'>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.16'>And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.17'>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.18'>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.19'>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.20'>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.21'>But Abijah became mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.22'>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.1'>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.2'>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.4'>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built, and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>And there came out against them Zerah the Cushite, with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathath at Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.11'>And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.12'>So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.13'>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Cushites were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.14'>And they smote all the cities about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.15'>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.1'>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.2'>And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.3'>Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.4'>But when they in their trouble returned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.5'>And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.6'>And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city: for God troubled them with all adversity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.7'>Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak; for your work shall be rewarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.8'>And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.9'>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they resorted to him out of Israel in multitudes, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.10'>So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.11'>And they offered to the LORD at the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.12'>And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.13'>That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.14'>And they swore to the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them: and the LORD gave them rest on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.17'>But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.18'>And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.19'>And there was no more war until the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.1'>In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.2'>Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.3'>There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.4'>And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.5'>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off the building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.6'>Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha was building, and he built with it Geba and Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.7'>And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore hath the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.8'>Were not the Cushites and the Lubims a numerous army, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.9'>For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him. In this thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.10'>Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.11'>And behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.12'>And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceedingly severe: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.13'>And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.14'>And they buried him in his own sepulchers which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.1'>And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.2'>And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.3'>And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.5'>Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand: and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.6'>And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.7'>Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.8'>And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.15'>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.16'>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.17'>Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still in the high places, yet to the LORD their God only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.19'>His prayer also, and how God was entreated by him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.20'>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.21'>Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.22'>But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.23'>And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.24'>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.25'>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.1'>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.2'>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.3'>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.4'>And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.5'>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.6'>And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.7'>And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.8'>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.9'>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had collected from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.10'>And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and mend the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.11'>Even to the artificers and builders they gave it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.12'>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to superintend it; and others of the Levites, all that had skill in instruments of music.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.13'>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.14'>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.15'>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.16'>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.17'>And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.18'>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.19'>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.20'>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.21'>Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel, and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.22'>And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.23'>And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.24'>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.25'>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.26'>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.27'>Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou didst hear his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.28'>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.29'>Then the king sent and convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.30'>And the king went into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.31'>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.32'>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin, to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.33'>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel, to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.35'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.1'>Moreover, Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover-offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>And his princes gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jehiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering burnt-offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>But he sent embassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he may not destroy thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself that he might fight with him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am severely wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they are written in the lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.27'>And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.36'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.1'>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.3'>And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.4'>And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.5'>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.11'>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.12'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.13'>And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.14'>Moreover, all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.15'>And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.</verse>
