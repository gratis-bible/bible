Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after this, he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish-gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great highth, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still in the high places, yet to the LORD their God only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>His prayer also, and how God was entreated by him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
