And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel, and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou didst hear his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin, to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel, to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
