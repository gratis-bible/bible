      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and the evening and the morning were the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This is the book of the generations of Adam: In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:</verse>
