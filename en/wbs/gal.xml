  <div osisID='Gal' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we said before, so I say now again, If any man preacheth any other gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>Neither did I go to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me: but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But I saw no other of the apostles, save James the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then fourteen years after I went again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But of these, who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat, in conference added nothing to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me towards the Gentiles:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before that certain came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? By no means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness is attainable by the law, then Christ hath died in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it is yet in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he this by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse: for it is written, Accursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Accursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it is but a man's covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance is by the law, it is no more by promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>What purpose then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law then against the promises of God? By no means: for if there had been a law given which could give life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Wherefore the law was our school-master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But after faith is come, we are no longer under a school-master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For ye are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he is lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>However then, when ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, after ye have known God, or rather are known by God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>Ye know that in infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What then was the blessedness ye spoke of; for I bear you testimony, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They zealously affect you, but not well; for, they would exclude you, that ye may affect them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he who was of the bond-woman, was born according to the flesh; but he of the free-woman was by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she who hath a husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; ye have fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Ye did run well, who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion cometh not from him that calleth you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then hath the offense of the cross ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I would they were even cut off who trouble you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For, brethren, ye have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one by another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual, restore such one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he that soweth to his flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption: but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall from the Spirit reap life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>Ye see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But may it never be that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
