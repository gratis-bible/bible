if he doth not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Or if a soul shall touch any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping animals, and it shall be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or if he shall touch the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness it may be that a man shall be defiled with, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or if a soul shall swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it may be, that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if he shall not be able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass which he hath committed, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if he shall not be able to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense upon it: for it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a soul shall commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add to it the fifth part, and give it to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if a soul shall sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering to the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is a trespass-offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>\6:1\And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>\6:2\If a soul shall sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie to his neighbor, in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>\6:3\Or hath found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>\6:4\Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by force, or the thing which he obtained by deceit, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>\6:5\Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add to it the fifth part more, and give it to him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>\6:6\And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>\6:7\And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
