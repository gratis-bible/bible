      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment: because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour its palaces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment: because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away its punishment: because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away their punishment: because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour its palaces, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away his punishment: because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>And I will cut off the judge from the midst of it, and will slay all its princes with him, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away their punishment: because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away their punishment: because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in to the same maid, to profane my holy name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose hight was like the hight of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Can two walk together, except they are agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he hath taken nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>Shalt a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst of it, and the oppressed in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even around the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus saith the LORD: As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, ye heifers of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fish-hooks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Beth-el and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free-offerings: for this pleaseth you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And also I have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece on which it rained not withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two or three cities wandered to one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees increased, the palmer-worm devoured them: yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the ill savor of your camps to come up to your nostrils: yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a fire-brand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned to me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore thus will I do to thee, O Israel: and because I will do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth to man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise! she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave a hundred, and that which went forth by a hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus saith the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to naught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shades of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: JEHOVAH is his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your meat-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Have ye offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, who are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass ye to Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves from the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellence of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore I will deliver up the city with all its abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>Ye who rejoice in a thing of naught, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>But behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the river of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me; and behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me: and behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>Thus he showed me: and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And the LORD said to me, Amos, what seest thou? and I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Also Amaziah said to Amos, O thou seer, go flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go from his land into captivity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>Thus hath the Lord GOD shown to me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD to me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'>Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</verse>
