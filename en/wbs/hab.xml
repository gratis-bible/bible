      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out to thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why dost thou show me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for devastation and violence are before me: and there are that raise strife and contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>Therefore the law is slackened, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth encompass the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling-places that are not theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed from themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power to his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: why lookest thou on them that deal treacherously, and keepest silence when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping animals that have no ruler over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their food plenteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand upon my watch, and seat myself upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it may tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Behold, his soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>Yes also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire, as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth to him all nations, and collecteth to him all people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Shall they not rise suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall disturb thee, and thou shalt be for booties to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because thou hast laid waste many nations, all the remnant of the people shall lay thee waste; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Behold, is it not from the LORD of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe to him that giveth his neighbor drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned to thee, and shameful vomiting shall be on thy glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What profiteth the graven image that its maker hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe to him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand; and there was the hiding of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thy anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thy horses, and thy chariots of salvation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thy arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thy anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by uncovering the foundation to the neck. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>Thou didst strike through with his staffs the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, through the mire of great waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</verse>
