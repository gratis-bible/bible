Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Wis.2.1'>For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.2'>For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.2.8'>Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.9'>Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.10'>Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.2.12'>Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.13'>He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.14'>He was made to reprove our thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.15'>He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men’s, his ways are of another fashion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.16'>We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.2.22'>As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.2.23'>For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Wis.3'>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.1'>But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.2'>In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.3'>And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.4'>For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.5'>And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.6'>As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.7'>And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.8'>They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.9'>They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.10'>But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.11'>For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.12'>Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.13'>Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.14'>And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.15'>For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.16'>As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.17'>For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.18'>Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.3.19'>For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Wis.4'>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.1'>Better it is to have no children, and to have virtue: for the memorial thereof is immortal: because it is known with God, and with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.2'>When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.3'>But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any fast foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.4'>For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standing not last, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.5'>The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.6'>For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.7'>But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.8'>For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.9'>But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.10'>He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.11'>Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.12'>For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.13'>He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.14'>For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.15'>This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.16'>Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected the many years and old age of the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.17'>For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall not understand what God in his counsel hath decreed of him, and to what end the Lord hath set him in safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.18'>They shall see him, and despise him; but God shall laugh them to scorn: and they shall hereafter be a vile carcase, and a reproach among the dead for evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.4.19'>For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, that they shall be speechless; and he shall shake them from the foundation; and they shall be utterly laid waste, and be in sorrow; and their memorial shall perish.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Wis.5'>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.1'>Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.2'>When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.3'>And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.4'>We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.5'>How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.6'>Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.7'>We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.8'>What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.9'>All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.10'>And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.11'>Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with the stroke of her wings and parted with the violent noise and motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.12'>Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth the air, which immediately cometh together again, so that a man cannot know where it went through:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.13'>Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began to draw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to shew; but were consumed in our own wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.14'>For the hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.15'>But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.5.16'>Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.8.5'>If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.6'>And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.7'>And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as men can have nothing more profitable in their life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.8.9'>Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.10'>For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.11'>I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgement, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.12'>When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.13'>Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.8.15'>Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.8.17'>Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.18'>And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.19'>For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.20'>Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.8.21'>Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.9.7'>Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.8'>Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.9.11'>For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.12'>So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father’s seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.13'>For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.14'>For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.15'>For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.16'>And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.17'>And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.9.18'>For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.12.11'>For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didst thou for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein they sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.12'>For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgement? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.12.15'>Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.16'>For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.17'>For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thou makest their boldness manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.18'>But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, and orderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power when thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.19'>But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.20'>For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.21'>With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.22'>Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.23'>Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.24'>For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.25'>Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgement to mock them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.26'>But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgement worthy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.12.27'>For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; now being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.17.11'>For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Wis.18.5'>And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints, one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookest away the multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.6'>Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that assuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they might afterwards be of good cheer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.7'>So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of the righteous, and destruction of the enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.8'>For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the same thou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.9'>For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints should be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singing out the songs of praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.10'>But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad for children that were bewailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.11'>The master and the servant were punished after one manner; and like as the king, so suffered the common person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.12'>So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind of death; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.13'>For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason of the enchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged this people to be the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.14'>For while all things were in quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.15'>Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.16'>And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.17'>Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore, and terrors came upon them unlooked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.18'>And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.19'>For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lest they should perish, and not know why they were afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.20'>Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, and there was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: but the wrath endured not long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.21'>For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.22'>So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, nor force of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished, alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.23'>For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one upon another, standing between, he stayed the wrath, and parted the way to the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.24'>For in the long garment was the whole world, and in the four rows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven, and thy Majesty upon the diadem of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.18.25'>Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Wis.19'>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.1'>As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy unto the end: for he knew before what they would do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.2'>How that having given them leave to depart, and sent them hastily away, they would repent and pursue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.3'>For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, and pursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.4'>For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them unto this end, and made them forget the things that had already happened, that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to their torments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.5'>And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but they might find a strange death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.6'>For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them, that thy children might be kept without hurt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.7'>As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stood before, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way without impediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.8'>Where through all the people went that were defended with thy hand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.9'>For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.10'>For they were yet mindful of the things that were done while they sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.11'>But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.12'>For quails came up unto them from the sea for their contentment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.13'>And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behaviour toward strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.14'>For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.15'>And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be had of those, because they used strangers not friendly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.16'>But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they had received with feastings, and were already made partakers of the same laws with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.17'>Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as those were at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassed about with horrible great darkness, every one sought the passage of his own doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.18'>For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.19'>For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.20'>The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue: and the water forgat his own quenching nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.21'>On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of the corruptible living things, though they walked therein; neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt to melt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Wis.19.22'>For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didst assist them in every time and place.</verse>
