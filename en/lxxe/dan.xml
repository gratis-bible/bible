Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave into his hand Joakim king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he brought them into the land of Sennaar <note>Gr. of</note> to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king told Asphanez his chief eunuch, to bring in some of the captive children of Israel, and of the seed of the kingdom, and of the <note>Hebrew word</note> princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>young men in whom was no blemish, and beautiful in appearance, and skilled in all wisdom, and possessing knowledge, and acquainted with prudence, and who had ability to stand in the house before the king, and the king gave commandment to teach them the learning and language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a daily portion from the king’s table, and from the wine which he drank; and gave orders to nourish them three years, and that afterwards they should stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now these were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach; and to Azarias, Abdenago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>And Daniel purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himself with the king’s table, nor with the wine of his drink: and he intreated the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and compassion with the chief of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink, lest he see your countenances gloomy in comparison of the young men your equals; also shall ye endanger my head to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>And Daniel said to Amelsad, whom the chief of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove now thy servants ten days; and let them give us <note>Gr. of seeds</note> pulse, and let us eat, and let us drink water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>And let our countenances be seen by thee, and the countenances of the children that eat at the king’s table; and deal with thy servants according as thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>And he hearkened to them, and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of the ten days their countenances appeared fairer and stouter in flesh, than the children that fed at the king’s table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>So Amelsad took away their supper and the wine of their drink, and gave them <note>Gr. seeds</note> pulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>And <note>Alex. to these four children</note> as for these four children, God gave them understanding and prudence in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>And at the end of the days, after which the king had given orders to bring them in, then the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king spoke with them; and there were not found out of them all any like Daniel, and Ananias and Misael, and Azarias: and they stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in every matter of wisdom and knowledge wherein the king questioned them, he found them ten times wiser than all the enchanters and sorcerers that were in all his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued till the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>In the second year of his reign Nabuchodonosor dreamed a dream, and his spirit was amazed, and his sleep departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>And the king gave orders to call the enchanters, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said to them, I have dreamed, and my spirit was <note>Gr. amazed</note> troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, saying, O king, live for ever: do thou tell the dream to thy servants, and we will declare the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing has departed from me: if ye do not make known to me the dream and the interpretation, ye shall be destroyed, and your houses shall be spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if ye make known to me the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and presents and much honour: only tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time, and said, Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>And the king answered and said, I verily know that ye are <note>Gr. redeeming time; or, watching to buy it; See Eph 5:16</note> trying to gain time, because ye see that the thing has gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>If then ye do not tell me the dream, I know that ye have concerted to utter before me a false and corrupt tale, until the time shall have past: tell me my dream, and I shall know that ye will also declare to me the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is no man upon the earth, who shall be able to make known the king’s matter: forasmuch as no great king or ruler asks such a question of an enchanter, magician, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>For the question which the king asks is difficult, and there is no one else who shall answer it before the king, but the gods, whose dwelling is not with any flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>Then the king in rage and anger commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>So the decree went forth, and they began to slay the wise men; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the <note>See note on Ge 39:1</note> captain of the royal guard, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon; saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>Chief magistrate of the king, wherefore has the preemptory command proceeded from the king? So Arioch made known the matter to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>And Daniel intreated the king to give him time, and that he might thus declare to the king the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>So Daniel went into his house, and made known the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias, his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>And they sought mercies from the God of heaven concerning this mystery; that Daniel and his friends might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night; and Daniel blessed the God of heaven, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>May the name of God be blessed from everlasting and to everlasting: for wisdom and understanding are his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changes times and seasons: he appoints kings, and removes them, giving wisdom to the wise, and prudence to them that have understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>he reveals deep and secret matters; knowing what is in darkness, and the light is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I give thanks to thee, and praise thee, O God of my fathers, for thou has given me wisdom and power, and has made known to me the things which we asked of thee; and thou has made known to me the king’s vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>And Daniel came to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon, but bring me in before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel before the king, and said to him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judea, who will declare the interpretation to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>And the king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltasar, Canst thou declare to me the dream which I saw, and the interpretation thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>And Daniel answered before the king, and said, The mystery which the king asks the explanation of is not in the power of the wise men, magicians, enchanters, or soothsayers to declare to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in heaven revealing mysteries, and he has made known to king Nabuchodonosor what things must come to pass in the last days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are as follows,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>O king: thy thoughts upon thy bed arose as to what must come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals mysteries has made known to thee what must come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>Moreover, this mystery has not been revealed to me by reason of wisdom which is in me beyond all others living, but for the sake of making known the interpretation to the king, that thou mightest know the thoughts of thine heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold <note>Lit. one image</note> an image: that image was great, and the appearance of it excellent, standing before thy face; and the form of it was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>It was an image, the head of which was of fine gold, its hands and breast and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs of iron, its feet, part of iron and part of earthenware.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou sawest until a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and earthenware, and utterly reduced them to powder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then once for all the earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold, were ground to powder, and became as <note>Or, dust, or, cloud of dust</note> chaff from the summer threshingfloor; and the violence of the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them: and the stone which had smitten the image became a great mountain, and filled all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given a powerful and strong and honourable kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>in every place where the children of men dwell: and he has given into thine hand the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, and he has made thee lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>Thou art the head of gold. And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and a third kingdom which is the brass, which shall have dominion over all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>and a fourth kingdom, which shall be strong as iron: as iron beats to powder and subdues all things, so shall it beat to powder and subdue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes, part of earthenware and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet there shall be in <note>Gr. of the iron root</note> it of the strength of iron, as thou sawest the iron mixed with earthenware.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And whereas the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of earthenware, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part of it shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>Whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with earthenware, they shall be mingled with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave together, as the iron does not mix itself with earthenware.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and his kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall beat to pieces and grind to powder all other kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Whereas thou sawest that a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it beat to pieces the earthenware, the iron, the brass, the silver, the gold; the great God has made known to the king what must happen hereafter: and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then king Nabuchodonosor fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and gave orders to offer to him gifts and incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>And the king answered and said to Daniel, Of a truth your God is a God of gods, and Lord of kings, who reveals mysteries; for thou has been able to reveal this mystery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>And the king promoted Daniel, and gave him great and abundant gifts, and set him over the whole province of Babylon, and made him chief satrap over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And Daniel asked of the king, and he appointed Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the king’s palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>In his eighteenth year Nabuchodonosor the king made a golden image, its height was sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits: and he set it up in the plain of Deira, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>And he sent forth to gather the governors, and the captains, and the heads of provinces, chiefs, and princes, and those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, to come to the dedication of the image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>So the heads of provinces, the governors, the captains, the chiefs, the great princes, those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, were gathered to the dedication of the image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up; and they stood before the image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, ye peoples, tribes, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>at what hour ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and every kind of music, ye shall fall down and worship the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor has set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whosoever shall not fall down and worship, in the same hour he shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>And it came to pass when the nations heard the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the nations, tribes, and languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Then came near certain Chaldeans, and accused the Jews to the king, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou, O king, has made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and all kinds of music,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>and shall not fall down and worship the golden image, shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou has appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who have not obeyed thy decree, O king: they serve not thy gods, and worship not the golden image which thou hast set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nabuchodonosor in wrath and anger commanded to bring Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and they were brought before the king.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now then if ye be ready, whensoever ye shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and psaltery, and harmony, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the golden image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, in the same hour ye shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace; and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Then answered Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago and said to king Nabuchodonosor, We have no need to answer thee concerning this matter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then Nabuchodonosor was filled with wrath, and the form of his countenance was changed toward Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than usual, until it should burn to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded mighty men to bind Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>Then these three men, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell bound into the midst of the burning furnace, and walked in the midst of the flame, singing praise to God, and blessing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>And Nabuchodonosor heard them singing praises; and he wondered, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? and they said to the king, Yes, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>And the king said, But I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and <note>Lit. there is no destruction in them</note> there has no harm happened to them; and the appearance of the fourth is like the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nabuchodonosor drew near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants of the most high God, proceed forth, and come hither. So Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, came forth out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>Then were assembled the satraps, and captains, and heads of provinces, and the royal princes; and they saw the men, and perceived that the fire had not had power against their <note>Gr. singular; compare 1 Co 6:19.</note> bodies, and the hair of their head was not burnt, and their coats were not <note>Gr. changed</note> scorched, nor was the smell of fire upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>And king Nabuchodonosor answered and said, Blessed be the God of Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants, because they trusted in him; and they have changed the king’s word, and delivered their bodies to be burnt, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Wherefore I publish a decree: Every people, tribe, or language, that shall speak reproachfully against the God of Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago shall be destroyed, and their houses shall be plundered: because there is no other God who shall be able to deliver thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the province of Babylon, and advanced them, and <note>Or, made, or, pronounced them worthy</note> gave them authority to rule over all the Jews who were in his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.31'>King Nabuchodonosor to all nations, tribes, and tongues, who dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.32'>It seemed good to me to declare to you the signs and wonders which the most high God has wrought with me,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>I Nabuchodonosor was thriving in my house, and prospering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>I saw a vision, and it terrified me, and I was troubled on my bed, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>And I made a decree to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>So the enchanters, magicians, soothsayers, and Chaldeans came in: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>until Daniel came, whose name is Baltasar, according to the name of my God, who has within him the Holy Spirit of God; to whom I said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>O Baltasar, chief of the enchanters, of whom I know that the Holy Spirit of God is in thee, and no mystery is too hard for thee, hear the vision of my dream which I had, and tell me the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>I had a vision upon my bed; and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>The tree grew large and strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its extent to the extremity of the whole earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>its leaves were fair, and its fruit abundant, and in it was meat for all; and under it the wild beasts of the field took shelter, and the birds of the sky lodged in the branches of it, and all flesh was fed of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>I beheld in the night vision upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven and cried aloud, and thus he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>Cut down the tree, and pluck off its branches, and shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the wild beasts be removed from under it, and the birds from its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>Only leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and bind it with an iron and brass band; and it shall lie in the grass that is without and in the dew of heaven, and its portion shall be with the wild beasts in the grass of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>His heart shall be changed from that of man, and the heart of a wild beast shall be given to him; and seven times shall pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>The matter is by the decree of the watcher, and the demand is a word of the holy ones; that the living may known that the Lord is most high over the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever he shall please, and will set up over it that which is set at nought of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>This is the <note>Gr. dream</note> vision which I king Nabuchodonosor saw: and do thou, Baltasar, declare the interpretation, for none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to shew me the interpretation of it: but thou, Daniel, art able; for the Holy Spirit of God is in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Then Daniel, whose name is Baltasar, was amazed about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. And Baltasar answered and said, My lord, let the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thine enemies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and he said, Strip the tree, and destroy it; only leave the stump of its roots in the ground, and bind it with a band of iron and brass; and it shall lie in the grass that is without, and in the dew of heaven, and its portion shall be with wild beasts, until seven times have passed over it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>this is the interpretation of it, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High, which <note>Gr. come by anticipation</note> has come upon my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>And they shall drive thee forth from men, and thy dwelling shall be with wild beasts, and they shall feed thee with grass as an ox, and thou shall have thy lodging under the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou known that the Most High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whom he shall please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And whereas they said, Leave the stumps of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom abides sure to thee from the time that thou shalt know the power of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>Therefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and atone for thy sins by alms, and thine iniquities by compassion on the poor: it may be God will be long-suffering to thy trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>After a twelvemonth, as he walked in his palace in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>the king answered and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for <note>Gr. a house of a kingdom</note> a royal residence, by the might of my power, for the honour of my glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>While the word was yet in the king’s mouth, there came a voice from heaven, saying, To thee, king Nabuchodonosor, they say, The kingdom has departed from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the wild beasts of the field, and they shall feed thee with grass as an ox: and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High is Lord of the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever he shall please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>In the same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor: and he was driven forth from men, and he ate grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his hairs were grown like lions’ hairs, and his nails as birds’ claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>And at the end of the time I Nabuchodonosor lifted up mine eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised him that lives for ever, and gave him glory; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom lasts to all generations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the <note>Lit. force, or power</note> army of heaven, and <note>Gr. in the habitation of the earth</note> among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none who shall withstand his power, and say to him, What has thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>At the same time my reason returned to me, and I came to the honour of my kingdom; and my natural form returned to me, and my princes, and my nobles, sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and more abundant majesty was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>Now therefore I Nabuchodonosor praise and greatly exalt and glorify the King of heaven; for all his works are true, and his paths are judgement: and all that walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.5'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.1'>Baltasar the king made a great supper for his thousand nobles, and there was wine before the thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.2'>And Baltasar drinking gave orders as he tasted the wine that they should bring the gold and silver vessels, which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought forth from the temple in Jerusalem; that the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his concubines, should drink out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.3'>So the gold and silver vessels were brought which Nabuchodonosor had taken out of the temple of God in Jerusalem; and the king, and his nobles, and his mistresses, and his concubines, drank out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.4'>They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of iron, and of wood, and of stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.5'>In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote in front of the lamp on the plaster of the wall of the king’s house: and the king saw the <note>Or, joints</note> knuckles of the hand that wrote.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.6'>Then the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.7'>And the king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; and he said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation, shall be clothed with scarlet, and there shall be a golden chain upon his neck, and he shall be the third ruler in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.8'>Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known the interpretation to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.9'>And king Baltasar was troubled, and his countenance changed upon him, and his nobles were troubled with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.10'>Then the queen came into the banquet house, and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, and let not thy countenance be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.11'>There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the Spirit of God; and in the days of thy father watchfulness and understanding were found in him; and king Nabuchodonosor thy father made him chief of the enchanters, magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>For there is an excellent spirit in him, and sense and understanding in him, interpreting dreams as he does, and answering hard questions, and solving difficulties: it is Daniel, and the king gave him the name of Baltasar: now then let him be called, and he shall tell thee the interpretation <note>Gr. of it, or of him</note> of the writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.13'>Then Daniel was brought in before the king: and the king said to Daniel, Art thou Daniel, of the children of the captivity of Judea, which the king my father brought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.14'>I have heard concerning thee, that the Spirit of God is in thee, and that watchfulness and understanding and excellent wisdom have been found in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.15'>And now, the wise men, magicians, and soothsayers, have come in before me, to read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation: but they could not tell it me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.16'>And I have heard concerning thee, that thou art able to make interpretations: now then if thou shalt be able to read the writing, and to make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and there shall be a golden chain upon thy neck, and thou shalt be third ruler in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.17'>And Daniel said, before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give the present of thine house to another; but I will read the writing, and will make known to thee the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.18'>O king, the most high God gave to thy father Nabuchodonosor a kingdom, and majesty, and honour, and glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.19'>and by reason of the majesty which he gave to him, all nations, tribes, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he smote; and whom he would he exalted; and whom he would he abased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.20'>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was emboldened to act proudly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his honour was taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.21'>And he was driven forth from men; and his heart was given him after the nature of wild beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and they fed him with grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the most high God is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whomsoever he shall please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.22'>And thou accordingly, his son, O Baltasar, has not humbled thine heart before God: knowest thou not all this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.23'>And thou has been exalted against the Lord God of heaven; and they have brought before thee the vessels of his house, and thou, and thy nobles, and thy mistresses, and thy concubines, have drunk wine out of them; and thou has praised the gods of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and wood, and stone, which see not, and which hear not, and know not: and the God in whose hand are thy breath, and all thy ways has thou not glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.5.24'>Therefore from his presence has been sent forth the <note>Or, joint</note> knuckle of a hand; and he has ordered the writing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I noticed his horns, and behold, another little horn came up in the midst of them, and before it three of the former horns were rooted out: and, behold, there were eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld until the thrones were set, and the Ancient of days sat; and his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head, as pure wool: his throne was a flame of fire, and his wheels burning fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>And the dominion of the rest of the wild beasts was taken away; but a prolonging of life was given them for <note>Lit. time and time</note> certain times.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>until the Ancient of days came, and he gave judgement to the saints of the Most High; and the time came on, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>And he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on the earth, which shall excel all other kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and trample and <note>Gr. cut it in pieces</note> destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And his ten horns are ten kings that shall arise: and after them shall arise another, who shall exceed all the former ones in <note>Gr. evil</note> wickedness and he shall subdue three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change times and law: and power shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a time.</verse>
