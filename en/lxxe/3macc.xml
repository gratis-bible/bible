Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

      <chapter osisID='3Macc.1'>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.1'>Now Philopater, on learning from those who came back that Antiochus had made himself master of the places which belonged to himself, sent orders to all his footmen and horsemen, took with him his sister Arsinoe, and marched out as far as the parts of Raphia, where Antiochus and his forces encamped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.2'>And one Theodotus, intending to carry out his design, took with him the bravest of the armed men who had been before committed to his trust by Ptolemy, and got through at night to the tent of Ptolemy, to kill him on his own responsibility, and so to end the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.3'>But Dositheus, called the son of Drimulus, by birth a Jew, afterward a renegade from the laws and observances of his country, conveyed Ptolemy away, and made an obscure person lie down in his stead in the tent. It befell this man to receive the fate which was meant for the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.4'>A fierce battle then took place; and the men of Antiochus prevailing, Arsinoe continually went up and down the ranks, and with dishevelled hair, with tears and entreaties, begged the soldiers to fight manfully for themselves, their children, and wives; and promised that if they proved conquerors, she would give them two minae of gold apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.5'>It thus fell out that their enemies were defeated in hand-to-hand encounter, and that many of them were taken prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.6'>Having vanquished this attempt, the king then decided to proceed to the neighbouring cities, and encourage them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.7'>By doing this, and by making donations to their temples, he inspired his subjects with confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.8'>The Jews sent some of their council and of their elders to him. The greetings, guest- gifts, and congratulations of the past, bestowed by them, filled him with the greater eagerness to visit their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.9'>Having arrived at Jerusalem, sacrificed, and offered thank-offerings to the Greatest God, and done whatever else was suitable to the sanctity of the place, and entered the inner court,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.10'>he was so struck with the magnificence of the place, and so wondered at the orderly arrangements of the temple, that he considered entering the sanctuary itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.11'>And when they told him that this was not permissible, none of the nation, no, nor even the priests in general, but only the supreme high priest of all, and he only once in a year, being allowed to go in, he would by no means give way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.12'>Then they read the law to him; but he persisted in obtruding himself, exclaiming, that he ought to be allowed: and saying Be it that they were deprived of this honour, I ought not to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.13'>And he put the question, Why, when he entered all the temples, none of the priests who were present forbad him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.14'>He was thoroughly answered by some one, That he did wrong to boast of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.15'>Well; since I have done this, said he, be the cause what it may, shall I not enter with or without your consent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.16'>And when the priests fell down in their sacred vestments imploring the Greatest God to come and help in time of need, and to avert the violence of the fierce aggressor, and when they filled the temple with lamentations and tears,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.17'>then those who had been left behind in the city were scared, and rushed forth, uncertain of the event.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.18'>Virgins, who had been shut up within their chambers, came out with their mothers, scattering dust and ashes on their heads, and filling the streets with outcries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.19'>Women, but recently separated off, left their bridal chambers, left the reserve that befitted them, and ran about the city in a disorderly manner. </verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.20'>New-born babes were deserted by the mothers or nurses who waited upon them; some here, some there, in houses, or in fields; these now, with an ardour which could not be checked, swarmed into the Most High temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.21'>Various were the prayers offered up by those who assembled in this place, on account of the unholy attempt of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.22'>Along with these there were some of the citizens who took courage, and would not submit to his obstinacy, and his intention of carrying out his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.23'>Calling out to arms, and to die bravely in defence of the law of their fathers, they created a great uproar in the place, and were with difficulty brought back by the aged and the elders to the station of prayer which they had occupied before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.24'>During this time the multitude kept on praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.25'>The elders who surrounded the king strove in many ways to divert his haughty mind from the design which he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.26'>He, in his hardened mood, insensible to all persuasion, was going onwards with the view of carrying out this design.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.27'>Yet even his own officers, when they saw this, joined the Jews in an appeal to Him who has all power, to aid in the present crisis, and not wink at such overweening lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.28'>Such was the frequency and the vehemence of the cry of the assembled crowd, that an indescribable noise ensued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.1.29'>Not the men only, but the very walls and floor seemed to sound forth; all things preferring dissolution rather than to see the place defiled.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='3Macc.2'>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.1'>Now was it that the high priest Simon bowed his knees over against the holy place, and spread out his hands in reverent form, and uttered the following supplication:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.2'>O Lord, Lord, King of the heavens, and Ruler of the whole creation, Holy among the holy, sole Governor, Almighty, give ear to us who are oppressed by a wicked and profane one, who exulteth in his confidence and strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.3'>It is thou, the Creator of all, the Lord of the universe, who art a righteous Governor, and judgest all who act with pride and insolence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.4'>It was thou who didst destroy the former workers of unrighteousness, among whom were the giants, who trusted in their strength and hardihood, by covering them with a measureless flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.5'>It was thou who didst make the Sodomites, those workers of exceeding iniquity, men notorious for their vices, an example to after generations, when thou didst cover them with fire and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.6'>Thou didst make known thy power when thou causedst the bold Pharaoh, the enslaver of thy people, to pass through the ordeal of many and diverse inflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.7'>And thou rolledst the depths of the sea over him, when he made pursuit with chariots, and with a multitude of followers, and gavest a safe passage to those who put their trust in thee, the Lord of the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.8'>These saw and felt the works of thine hands, and praised thee the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.9'>Thou, O King, when thou createdst the illimitable and measureless earth, didst choose out this city: thou didst make this place sacred to thy name, albeit thou needest nothing: thou didst glorify it with thine illustrious presence, after constructing it to the glory of thy great and honourable name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.10'>And thou didst promise, out of love to the people of Israel, that should we fall away from thee, and become afflicted, and then come to this house and pray, thou wouldest hear our prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.11'>Verily thou art faithful and true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.12'>And when thou didst often aid our fathers when hard pressed, and in low estate, and deliveredst them out of gret dangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.13'>see now, holy King, how through our many and great sins we are borne down, and made subject to our enemies, and are become weak and powerless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.14'>We being in this low condition, this bold and profane man seeks to dishonour this thine holy place, consecrated out of the earth to the name of thy Majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.15'>Thy dwelling place, the heaven of heavens, is indeed unapproachable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.16'>But since it seemed good to thee to exhibit thy glory among thy people Israel, thou didst sanctify this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.16'>Punish us not by means of the uncleanness of their men, nor chastise us by means of their profanity; lest the lawless ones should boast in their rage, and exult in exuberant pride of speech, and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.18'>We have trampled upon the holy house, as idolatrous houses are trampled upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.19'>Blot out our iniquities, and do away with our errors, and shew forth thy compassion in this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.20'>Let thy mercies quickly go before us. Grant us peace, that the cast down and broken hearted may praise thee with their mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.21'>At that time God, who seeth all things, who is beyond all Holy among the holy, heard that prayer, so suitable; and scourged the man greatly uplifted with scorn and insolence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.22'>Shaking him to and fro as a reed is shaken with the wind, he cast him upon the pavement, powerless, with limbs paralyzed; by a righteous judgement deprived of the faculty of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.23'>His friends and bodyguards, beholding the swift recompense which had suddenly overtaken him, struck with exceeding terror, and fearing that he would die, speedily removed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.24'>When in course of time he had come to himself, this severe check caused no repentance within him, but he departed with bitter threatenings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.25'>He proceeded to Egypt, grew worse in wickedness through his beforementioned companions in wine, who were lost to all goodness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.26'>and not satisfied with countless acts of impiety, his audacity so increased that he raised evil reports there, and many of his friends, watching his purpose attentively, joined in furthering his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.27'>His purpose was to indict a public stigma upon our race; wherefore he erected a pillar at the tower-porch, and caused the following inscription to be engraved upon it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.28'>That entrance to their own temple was to be refused to all those who would not sacrifice; that all the Jews were to be registered among the common people; that those who resisted were to be forcibly seized and put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.29'>that those who were thus registered, were to be marked on their persons by the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus, and to be set apart with these limited rights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.30'>To do away with the appearance of hating them all, he had it written underneath, that if any of them should elect to enter the community of those initiated in the rites, these should have equal rights with the Alexandrians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.31'>Some of those who were over the city, therefore, abhorring any approach to the city of piety, unhesitatingly gave in to the king, and expected to derive some great honour from a future connection with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.32'>A nobler spirit, however, prompted the majority to cling to their religious observances, and by paying money that they might live unmolested, these sought to escape the registration:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.2.33'>cheerfully looking forward to future aid, they abhorred their own apostates, considering them to be national foes, and debarring them from the common usages of social intercourse.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='3Macc.3'>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.1'>On discovering this, so incensed was the wicked king, that he no longer confined his rage to the Jews in Alexandria. Laying his hand more heavily upon those who lived in the country, he gave orders that they should be quickly collected into one place, and most cruelly deprived of their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.2'>While this was going on, an invidious rumour was uttered abroad by men who had banded together to injure the Jewish race. The purport of their charge was, that the Jews kept them away from the ordinances of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.3'>Now, while the Jews always maintained a feeling of un-swerving loyalty towards the kings, yet, as they worshipped God, and observed his law, they made certain distinctions, and avoided certain things. Hence some persons held them in odium; although, as they adorned their conversation with works of righteousness, they had established themselves in the good opinion of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.6'>What all the rest of mankind said, was, however, made of no account by the foreigners;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.7'>who said much of the exclusiveness of the Jews with regard to their worship and meats; they alleged that they were men unsociable, hostile to the king's interests, refusing to associate with him or his troops. By this way of speaking, they brought much odium upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.8'>Nor was this unexpected uproar and sudden conflux of people unobserved by the Greeks who lived in the city, concerning men who had never harmed them: yet to aid them was not in their power, since all was oppression around; but they encouraged them in their troubles, and expected a favourable turn of affairs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.9'>He who knoweth all things, will not, said they, disregard so great a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.10'>Some of the neighbors, friends, and fellow dealers of the Jews, even called them secretly to an interview, pledged them their assistance, and promised to do their very utmost for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.11'>Now the king, elated with his prosperous fortune, and not regarding the superior power of God, but thinking to persevere in his present purpose, wrote the following letter to the prejudice of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.12'>King Ptolemy Philopater, to the commanders and soldiers in Egypt, and in all places, health and happiness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.13'>I am right well; and so, too, are my affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.14'>Since our Asiatic campaign, the particulars of which ye know, and which by the aid of the gods, not lightly given, and by our own vigour, has been brought to a successful issue according to our expectation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.15'>we resolved, not with strength of spear, but with gentleness and much humanity, as it were to nurse the inhabitants of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and to be their willing benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.16'>So, having bestowed considerable sums of money upon the temples of the several cities, we proceeded even as far as Jerusalem; and went up to honour  the temple of these wretched beings who never cease from their folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.17'>To outward appearance they received us willingly; but belied that appearance by their deeds. When we were eager to enter their temple, and to honour it with the most beautiful and exquisite gifts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.18'>they were so carried away by their old arrogance, as to forbid us the entrance; while we, out of our forbearance toward all men, refrained from exercising our power upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.19'>And thus, exhibiting their enmity against us, they alone among the nations lift up their heads against kings and benefactors, as men unwilling to submit to any thing reasonable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.20'>We then, having endeavoured to make allowance for the madness of these persons, and on our victorious return treating all people in Egypt courteously, acted in a manner which was befitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.21'>Accordingly, bearing no ill-will against their kinsmen at Jerusalem, but rather remembering our connection with them, and the numerous matters with sincere heart from a remote period entrusted to them, we wished to venture a total alteration of their state, by bestowing upon them the rights of citizens of Alexandria, and to admit them to the everlasting rites of our solemnities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.22'>All this, however, they have taken in a very different spirit. With their innate malignity, they have spurned the fair offer; and constantly inclining to evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.23'>have rejected the inestimable rights. Not only so, but by using speech, and by refraining from speech, they abhor the few among them who are heartily disposed towards us; ever deeming that their ignoble course of procedure will force us to do away with our reform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.24'>Having then, received certain proofs that these Jews bear us every sort of ill-will, we must look forward to the possibility of some sudden tumult among ourselves, when these impious men may turn traitors and barbarous enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.25'>As soon, therefore, as the contents of this letter become known to you, in that same hour we order those Jews who dwell among you, with wives and children, to be sent to us, vilified and abused, in chains of iron, to undergo a death, cruel and ignominious, suitable to men disaffected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.26'>For by the punishment of them in one body we perceive that we have found the only means of establishing our affairs for the future on a firm and satisfactory basis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.27'>Whosoever shall shield a Jew, whether it be old man, child, or suckling, shall with his whole house be tortured to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.28'>Whoever shall inform against the Jews, besides receiving the property of the person charged, shall be presented with two thousand drachmae from the royal treasury, shall be made free, and shall be crowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.29'>Whatever place shall shelter a Jew, shall, when he is hunted forth, be put under the ban of fire, and be for ever rendered useless to every living being for all time to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.3.30'>Such was the purport of the king's letter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='3Macc.4'>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.1'>Wherever this decree was received, the people kept up a revelry of joy and shouting; as if their long-pent-up, hardened hatred, were now to shew itself openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.2'>The Jews suffered great throes of sorrow, and wept much; while their hearts, all things around being lamentable, were set on fire as they bewailed the sudden destruction which was decreed against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.3'>What home, or city, or place at all inhabited, or what streets were there, which their condition did not fill with wailing and lamentation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.4'>They were sent out unanimously by the generals in the several cities, with such stern and pitiless feeling, that the exceptional nature of the infliction moved even some of their enemies. These, influenced by sentiments of common humanity, and reflecting upon the uncertain issue of life, shed tears at this their miserable expulsion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.5'>A multitude of aged hoary-haired old men, were driven along with halting bending feet, urged onward by the impulse of a violent, shameless force to quick speed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.6'>Girls who had entered the bridal chamber quite lately, to enjoy the partnership of marriage, exchanged pleasure for misery; and with dust scattered upon their myrrh-anointed heads, were hurried along unveiled; and, in the midst of outlandish insults, set up with one accord a lamentable cry in lieu of the marriage hymn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.7'>Bound, and exposed to public gaze, they were hurried violently on board ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.8'>The husbands of these, in the prime of their youthful vigour, instead of crowns wore halters round their necks; instead of feasting and youthful jollity, spent the rest of their nuptial days in wailings, and saw only the grave at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.9'>They were dragged along by unyielding chains, like wild beasts: of these, some had their necks thrust into the benches of the rowers; while the feet of others were enclosed in hard fetters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.10'>The planks of the deck above them barred out the light, and shut out the day on every side, so that they might be treated like traitors during the whole voyage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.11'>They were conveyed accordingly in this vessel, and at the end of it arrived at Schedia. The king had ordered them to be cast into the vast hippodrome, which was built in front of the city. This place was well adapted by its situation to expose them to the gaze of all comers into the city, and of those who went from the city into the country. Thus they could hold no communication with his forces; nay, were deemed unworthy of any civilized accommodation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.12'>When this was done, the king, hearing that their brethren in the city often went out and lamented the melancholy distress of these victims,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.13'>was full of rage, and commanded that they should be carefully subjected to the same (and not one whit milder) treatment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.14'>The whole nation was now to be registered. Every individual was to be specified by name; not for that hard servitude of labour which we have a little before mentioned, but that he might expose them to the before-mentioned tortures; and finally, in the short space of a day, might extirpate them by his cruelties</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.15'>The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.16'>The king was filled with great and constant joy, and celebrated banquets before the temple idols. His erring heart, far from the truth, and his profane mouth, gave glory to idols, deaf and incapable of speaking or aiding, and uttered unworthy speech against the Greatest God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.17'>At the end of the above-mentioned interval of time, the registrars brought word to the king that the multitude of the Jews was too great for registration,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.18'>inasmuch as there were many still left in the land, of whom some were in inhabited houses, and others were scattered about in various places; so that all the commanders in Egypt were insufficient for the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.19'>The king threatened them, and charged them with taking bribes, in order to contrive the escape of the Jews: but was clearly convinced of the truth of what had been said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.20'>They said, and proved, that paper and pens had failed them for the carrying out of their purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.4.21'>Now this was an active interference of the unconquerable Providence which assisted the Jews from heaven.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='3Macc.5'>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.1'>Then he called Hermon, who had charge of the elephants. Full of rage, altogether fixed in his furious design,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.2'>he commanded him, with a quantity of unmixed wine and handfuls of incense infused to drug the elephants early on the following day. These five hundred elephants were, when infuriated by the copious draughts of frankincense, to be led up to the execution of death upon the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.3'>The king, after issuing these orders, went to his feasting, and gathered together all those of his friends and of the army who hated the Jews the most.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.4'>The master of the elephants, Hermon, fulfilled his commission punctually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.5'>The underlings appointed for the purpose went out about eventide and bound the hands of the miserable victims, and took other precautions for their security at night, thinking that the whole race would perish together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.6'>The heathen believed the Jews to be destitute of all protection; for chains fettered them about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.7'>they invoked the Almighty Lord, and ceaselessly besought with tears their merciful God and Father, Ruler of all, Lord of every power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.8'>to overthrow the evil purpose which was gone out against them, and to deliver them by extraordinary manifestation from that death which was in store for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.9'>Their litany so earnest went up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.10'>Then Hermon, who had filled his merciless elephants with copious draughts of mingled wine and frankincense, came early to the palace to certify the kind thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.11'>He, however, who has sent his good creature sleep from all time by night or by day thus gratifying whom he wills, diffused a portion thereof now upon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.12'>By this sweet and profound influence of the Lord he was held fast, and thus his unjust purpose was quite frustrated, and his unflinching resolve greatly falsified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.13'>But the Jews, having escaped the hour which had been fixed, praised their holy God, and again prayed him who is easily reconciled to display the power of his powerful hand to the overweening Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.14'>The middle of the tenth hour had well nigh arrived, when the master-  bidder, seeing the guests who were bidden collected, came and shook the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.15'>He gained his attention with difficulty, and hinting that the mealtime was getting past, talked the matter over with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.16'>The kind listened to this, and then turning aside to his potations, commanded the guests to sit down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.17'>This done, he asked them to enjoy themselves, and to indulge in mirth at this somewhat late hour of the banquet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.18'>Conversation grew on, and the king sent for Hermon, and enquired of him, with fierce denunciations, why the Jews had been allowed to outlive that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.19'>Hermon explained that he had done his bidding over night; and in this he was confirmed by his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.20'>The king, then, with a barbarity exceeding that of Phalaris, said, That they might thank his sleep of that day. Lose no time, and get ready the elephants against tomorrow, as you did before, for the destruction of these accursed Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.21'>When the king said this, the company present were glad, and approved; and then each man went to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.22'>Nor did they employ the night in sleep, so much as in contriving cruel mockeries for those deemed miserable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.23'>The morning cock had just crowed, and Hermon, having harnessed the brutes, was stimulating them in the great colonnade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.24'>The city crowds were collected together to see the hideous spectacle, and waited impatiently for the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.25'>The Jews, breathless with momentary suspense, stretched forth their hands, and prayed the Greatest God, in mournful strains, again to help them speedily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.26'>The sun's rays were not yet shed abroad, and the king was waiting for his friends, when Hermon came to him, calling him out, and saying, That his desires could now be realized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.27'>The king, receiving him, was astonished at his unwonted exit; and, overwhelmed with a spirit of oblivion about everything, enquired the object of this earnest preparation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.28'>But this was the wroking of that Almighty God who had made him forget all his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.29'>Hermon, and all his friends, pointed out the preparation of the animals. they are ready, O king, according to your own strict injunction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.30'>The king was filled with fierce anger at these words; for, by the Providence of God regarding these things, his mind had become entirely confused. He looked hard at Hermon, and threatened him as follows:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.31'>Your parents, or your children, were they here, to these wild beasts a large repast they should have furnished; not these innocent Jews, who me and my forefathers loyally have served.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.32'>Had it not been for familar friendship, and the claims of your office, your life should have gone for theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.33'>Hermon, being threatened in this unexpected and alarming manner, was troubled in visage, and depressed in countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.34'>The friends, too, stole out one by one, and dismissed the assembled multitudes to their respective occupations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.35'>The Jews, having heard of these events, praised the glorious God and King of kings, because they had obtained this help, too, from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.36'>Now the king arranged another banquet after the same manner, and proclaimed an invitation to mirth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.27'>And he summoned Hermon to his presence, and said, with threats, How often, O wretch, must I repeat my orders to thee about these same persons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.28'>Once more, arm the elephants against the morrow for the extermination of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.39'>His kinsmen, who were reclining with him, wondered at his instability, and thus expressed themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.40'>O king, how long dost thou make trial of us, as of men bereft of reason? This is the third time that thou hast ordered their destruction. When the thing is to be done, thou changest thy mind, and recallest thy instructions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.41'>For this cause the feeling of expectation causes tumult in the city: it swarms with factions; and is continually on the point of being plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.42'>The king, just like another Phalaris, a prey to thoughtlessness, made no account of the changes which his own mind had undergone, issuing in the deliverance of the Jews. He swore a fruitless oath, and determined forthwith to send them to hades, crushed by the knees and feet of the elephants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.43'>He would also invade Judea, and level its towns with fire and the sword; and destroy that temple which the heathen might not enter, and prevent sacrifices ever after being offered up there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.44'>Joyfully his friends broke up, together with his kinsmen; and, trusting in his determination, arranged their forces in guard at the most convenient places of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.45'>And the master of the elephants urged the beasts into an almost maniacal state, drenched them with incense and wine, and decked them with frightful instruments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.46'>About early morning, when the city was now filled with an immense number of people at the hippodrome, he entered the palace, and called the king to the business in hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.47'>The king's heart teemed with impious rage; and he rushed forth with the mass, along with the elephants. With feelings unsoftened, and eyes pitiless, he longed to gaze at the hard and wretched doom of the abovementioned Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.48'>But the Jews, when the elephants went out at the gate, followed by the armed force; and when they saw the dust raised by the throng, and heard the loud cries of the crowd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.49'>thought that they had come to the last moment of their lives, to the end of what they had tremblingly expected. They gave way, therefore, to lamentations and moans: they kissed each other: those nearest of kin to each other hung about one another's necks: fathers about their sons, mother their daughters: other women held their infants to their breasts, which drew what seemed their last milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.50'>Nevertheless, when they reflected upon the succour before granted them from heaven, they prostrated themselves with one accord; removed even the sucking children from the breasts, and</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.5.51'>sent up an exceeding great cry entreating the Lord of all power to reveal himself, and have mercy upon those who now lay at the gates of hades.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='3Macc.6'>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.1'>And Eleazar, an illustrious priest of the country, who had attained to length of day, and whose life had been adorned with virtue, caused the presbyters who were about him to cease to cry out to the holy God, and prayed thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.2'>O king, mighty in power, most high, Almighty God, who regulates the whole creation with thy tender mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.3'>look upon the seed of Abraham, upon the children of the sanctified Jacob, thy sanctified inheritance, O Father, now being wrongfully destroyed as strangers in a strange land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.4'>Thou destroyedst Pharaoh, with his hosts of chariots, when that lord of this same Egypt was uplifted with lawless hardihood and loud-sounding tongue. Shedding the beams of thy mercy upon the race of Israel, thou didst overwhelm him with his proud army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.5'>When Sennacherim, the grievous king of the Assyrians, glorying in his countless hosts, had subdued the whole land with his spear, and was lifting himself against thine holy city, with boastings grievous to be endured, thou, O Lord, didst demolish him and didst shew forth thy might to many nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.6'>When the three friends in the land of Babylon of their own will exposed their lives to the fire rather than serve vain things, thou didst send a dewy coolness through the fiery furnace, and bring the fire upon all their adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.7'>It was thou who, when Daniel was hurled, through slander and envy, as a prey to lions down below, didst bring him back against unhurt to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.8'>When Jonah was pining away in the belly of the sea-bred monster, thou didst look upon him, O Father, and recover him to the sight of his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.9'>And now, thou who hatest insolence; thou who dost abound in mercy; thou who art the protector of all things; appear quickly to those of the race of Israel, who are insulted by abhorred, lawless gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.10'>If our life has during our exile been stained with iniquity, deliver us from the hand of the enemy, and destroy us, O Lord, by the death which thou preferrest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.11'>Let not the vain-minded congratulate vain idols at the destruction of thy beloved, saying, Neither did their god deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.12'>Thou, who art All-powerful and Almighty, O Eternal One, behold! have mercy upon us who are being withdrawn from life, like traitors, by the unreasoning insolence of lawless men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.13'>Let the heathen cower before thine invincible might today, O glorious One, who hast all power to save the race of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.14'>The whole band of infants and their parents with tears beseech thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.15'>Let it be shewn to all the nations that thou art with us, O Lord, and hast not turned thy face away from us; but as thou saidst that thou wouldst not forget them even in the land of their enemies, so do thou fulfil this saying, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.16'>Now, at the time that Eleazar had ended his prayer, the king came along to the hippodrome, with the wild beasts, and with his tumultuous power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.17'>When the Jews saw this, they uttered a loud cry to heaven, so that the adjacent valleys resounded, and caused an irrepressible lamentation throughout the army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.18'>Then the all-glorious, all-powerful, and true God, displayed his holy countenance, and opened the gates of heaven, from which two angels, dreadful of form, came down and were visible to all but the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.19'>And they stood opposite, and filled the enemies' host with confusion and cowardice; and bound them with immoveable fetters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.20'>And a cold shudder came over the person of the king, and oblivion paralysed the vehemence of his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.21'>They turned back the animals upon the armed forces which followed them; and the animals trod them down, and destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.22'>The king's wrath was converted into compassion; and he wept at his own machinations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.23'>For when he heard the cry, and saw them all on the verge of destruction, with tears he angrily threatened his friends, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.24'>Ye have governed badly; and have exceeded tyrants in cruelty; and me your benefactor ye have laboured to deprive at once of my dominion and my life, by secretly devising measures injurious to the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.25'>Who has gathered here, unreasonably removing each from his home, those who, in fidelity to us, had held the fortresses of the country?</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.26'>Who has thus consigned to unmerited punishments those who in good will towards us from the beginning have in all things surpassed all nations, and who often have engaged in the most dangerous undertakings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.27'>Loose, loose the unjust bonds; send them to their homes in peace, and deprecate what has been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.28'>Release the sons of the almighty living God of heaven, who from our ancestors' times until now has granted a glorious and uninterrupted prosperity to our affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.29'>These things he said; and they, released the same moment, having now escaped death, praised God their holy Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.30'>The king then departed to the city, and called his financier to him, and bade him provide a seven days' quantity of wine and other materials for feasting for the Jews. He decided that they should keep a gladsome festival of deliverance in the very place in which they expected to meet with their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.31'>Then they who were before despised and nigh unto hades, yea, rather advanced into it, partook of the cup of salvation, instead of a grievous and lamentable death. Full of exultation, they parted out the place intended for their fall and burial into banqueting booths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.32'>Ceasing their miserable strain of woe, they took up the subject of their fatherland, hymning in praise God their wonder-working Saviour. All groans, all wailing, were laid aside: they formed dances in token of serene joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.33'>So, also, the king collected a number of guests for the occasion, and returned unceasing thanks with much magnificence for the unexpected deliverance afforded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.34'>Those who had marked them out as for death and for carrion, and had registered them with joy, howled aloud, and were clothed with shame, and had the fire of their rage ingloriously put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.35'>But the Jews, as we just said, instituted a dance, and then gave themselves up to feasting, glad thanksgivings, and psalms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.36'>They made a public ordinance to commemorate these things for generations to come, as long as they should be sojourners. They thus established these days as days of mirth, not for the purpose of drinking or luxury, but because God had saved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.37'>They requested the king to send them back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.38'>They were being enrolled from the twenty-fifth of Pachon to the fourth of Epiphi, a period of forty days: the measures taken for their destruction lasted from the fifth of Epiphi till the seventh, that is, three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.39'>The Ruler over all did during this time manifest forth his mercy gloriously, and did deliver them all together unharmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.40'>They feasted upon the king's provision up to the fourteenth day, and then asked to be sent away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.6.41'>The king commended them, and wrote the subjoined letter, of magnanimous import for them, to the commanders of every city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='3Macc.7.3'>Certain of our friends did of malice vehemently urge us to punish the Jews of our realm in a body, with the infliction of a monstrous punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.7.4'>They pretended that our affairs would never be in a good state till this took place. Such, they said, was the hatred borne by the Jews to all other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3Macc.7.5'>They brought them fettered in grievous chains as slaves, nay, as traitors. Without enquiry or examination they endeavoured to annihilate them. They buckled themselves with a savage cruelty, worse than Scythian custom.</verse>
