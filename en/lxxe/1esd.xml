Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Septuagint is the most ancient translation of the Old Testament into
  Greek. The translators were likely Jews of the dispersion, living in
  Alexandria, Egypt.

  The beginning of the Jewish presence in Egypt is difficult to date
  precisely. There may have been a Jewish colony there as early as the tenth
  century BC, when Shishak (Shashanq) invaded Palestine and took treasures
  from the temple and the king's palace (2 Chronicles 12.1-8). But certainly a
  number of Jews lived in Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah (~586 BC), when
  "the captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were afraid
  of the Chaldeans" (2 Kings 25-26). Jeremiah, Baruch, and the princesses also
  went into Egypt at that time, though Jeremiah prophecied that they would all
  "perish by the sword and by famine, until not one is left" (Jeremiah 43.6,
  44.27). One expects, on the basis of that prophecy, that this was not the
  beginning of a permanent settlement. A lasting Jewish presence in Egypt can,
  however, be definitely dated from the the time of the founding of the city
  of Alexandria in 332 BC, when Alexander the Great granted them citizenship.

  In time, the Jews in Alexandria lost familiarity with Hebrew, and spoke
  Greek instead. It was natural, then, that they would require a translation
  of the scriptures into Greek for public worship in the synagogues and for
  private study. An account of the translation of the Septuagint is told in
  The Letter of Aristeas, which claims that Demetrius Phalereus, who ran the
  royal library in Alexandria, urged the king (Philadelphus (285-247 BC)) to
  obtain a copy of the Jewish law for the library. Philadelphus sent a
  deputation to the high priest Eleazar in Jerusalem, and the result was that
  seventy-two elders arrived in Egypt with a copy of the Hebrew law written on
  rolls of skins in golden letters. They were given accommodations on the
  island of Pharos, and completed their translation in seventy-two days. The
  same basic account is given in Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus.

  Even if the account given in the Letter of Aristeas is inaccurate, it seems
  clear that the Hebrew Old Testament was available in Greek in Alexandria
  before the birth of Christ. As Christianity began to spread, the Septuagint
  was used with persuasive effect by Christian apologists - so well, in fact,
  that in time the Jews of the dispersion replaced it with newer works. For
  instance, a proselyte to Judaism named Aquila completed a extremely literal
  translation of the Old Testament into Greek about the year 128. Other
  translations were made by Theodotion of Ephesus and a certain Symmachus,
  called an Ebionite, also in the second century.

  The most ancient manuscripts of the complete (or nearly complete) Septuagint
  are known as Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, and Alexandrinus. Vaticanus and
  Sinaiticus have been dated to the mid-fourth century, and Alexandrinus to
  the fifth. 

  Based on an earlier Hebrew original, the Septuagint departs from the
  Masoretic text* frequently. "The book of Jeremiah is noteworthy," for
  instance, "in that the present Hebrew text differs substantially from the
  Greek version (the Septuagint) in both content and order. Thus the
  Septuagint omits several passages (e.g., 33.14-26) and combines the oracles
  against foreign nations into a single section following 25.14, though in a
  different order. In addition, there are many smaller differences from verse
  to verse. Remarkably, among the portions of the text of Jeremiah in Hebrew
  that are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls are not only those that reflect
  the standard Hebrew text but also those that reflect the text tradition
  represented by the Septuagint. It is likely, then, that these two text
  traditions represent the contrasting editorial work on the book of Jeremiah
  that took place in Egypt (the Septuagint tradition) and in Palestine or
  Babylon (the traditional Hebrew text)." [Introduction to the book of
  Jeremiah, The New Oxford Annotated Bible, page 960.] Around the end of the
  first century, the Hebrew text was standardized to a form nearly identical
  with the modern Masoretic text. Variant readings, such as those represented
  in the Septuagint, were no longer transmitted in the Hebrew language. 

      * The Masoretic text is the source from which modern translations intoEnglish are made. While the oldest complete manuscripts of theSeptuagint date from the fourth century, the oldest complete HebrewOld Testament, the Leningrad Codex, was copied in ~ 1008 A.D. ModernEnglish translations of the Old Testament rely primarily on theLeningrad Codex as published in the Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Forexamples of Septuagint departures from the Masoretic text supported bythe Dead Sea Scrolls, see the appendix.

      * Another contrast between the Septuagint and the modern Hebrew OldTestament involves the canon of scripture. The Septuagint includesseveral books and sections of books absent from the modern Hebrewtext: 1 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; 1-3 Maccabees; the Wisdom of Solomon;the Wisdom of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus); Baruch; the Epistle ofJeremiah; The Song of the Three Children; Daniel and Susanna; Daniel,Bel and the Dragon; Additions to the Book of Esther; Psalm 151; andthe Prayer of Manasseh. The difference in content has been explainedin various ways. Perhaps the most straightforward account is that theJews of Alexandria had a relatively broad canon, which was generallyadopted by the Christians as they employed the Septuagint as their OldTestament. The Jews of Palestine, when they established their canonaround the turn of the first century at the council of Jamnia, mayhave been reiterating the position that had been more or less settledin Palestine for some time - though some books just made (Esther,Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Ezekiel, for instance) ormissed (Sirach) the cut. The conflict with Christians may have servedas a catalyst to push the Jews of the dispersion into the Palestiniancamp. This article - concerned with the text of the books within theHebrew canon - will not address the controversy surrounding the OldTestament canon in any depth.

  From the time of Jerome (early fifth century), Old Testament translations to
  the vernacular in the West have used the Hebrew as the primary source - the
  Septuagint has been relegated to a secondary role. (Incidentally, some are
  under the mistaken impression - given by misleading language in the preface
  to the 1899 edition - that the Douay Old Testament was translated from a
  Latin text based on the Septuagint. Unfortunately, Jerome's Vulgate - apart
  from the Psalms and the books then available only in Greek - by and large
  follows the Hebrew text.) It is hoped that the reader will reconsider the
  wisdom of this course of action, given the clear preference the New
  Testament displays for Septuagint readings. Fortunately, a new English
  translation of the Septuagint is being prepared for publication in 2004.

  This article comprises two main sections. The first deals with the early
  Church’s use of the Septuagint - particularly their sense that the Hebrew
  text was unreliable. It begins with the discussion between Jerome and
  Augustine regarding the former’s decision to craft his Latin translation
  from the available Hebrew text, rather than from the Septuagint. It is from
  Jerome’s fateful choice that the West derives its tradition of favoring the
  Hebrew to the Greek. The second part of this article provides a detailed
  comparison of the New Testament quotations from the Old. These were made to
  assess the extent to which the New Testament authors depended on the
  Septuagint instead of the Hebrew text. Conclusions are given in the The
  Septuagint in the New Testament.

        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.3'>And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel, that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.4'>And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders: now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his people Israel, and prepare you after your families and kindreds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.5'>According as David the king of Israel prescribed, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in the temple according to the several dignity of the families of you the Levites, who minister in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.6'>Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.7'>And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves: these things were given of the king’s allowance, according as he promised, to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.8'>And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.9'>And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias, and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.11'>And according to the several dignities of the fathers, before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses: and thus did they in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.12'>And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth: as for the sacrifices, they sod them in brass pots and pans with a good savour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.13'>And set them before all the people: and afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.14'>For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levites prepared for themselves, and the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.16'>Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawful for any to go from his ordinary service: for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.17'>Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that they might hold the passover,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.18'>And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.19'>So the children of Israel which were present held the passover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.20'>And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.21'>Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.22'>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.23'>And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart full of godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.24'>As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were written in former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.25'>Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.26'>But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.27'>I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.28'>Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.29'>But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.30'>Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.31'>Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father’s sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.32'>And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.33'>These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.34'>And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.35'>And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.36'>And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.37'>The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.38'>And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.39'>Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.40'>Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.41'>Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.42'>But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.43'>And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.44'>And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.45'>So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.46'>And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.47'>And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.48'>And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.49'>The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.50'>Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.51'>But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.52'>So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.53'>Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.54'>And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.55'>As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.56'>And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.57'>Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.1.58'>Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Esd.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.1'>In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord might be accomplished, that he had promised by the mouth of Jeremy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.2'>The Lord raised up the spirit of Cyrus the king of the Persians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, and also by writing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.3'>Saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians; The Lord of Israel, the most high Lord, hath made me king of the whole world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.4'>And commanded me to build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.5'>If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel: for he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.6'>Whosoever then dwell in the places about, let them help him, those, I say, that are his neighbours, with gold, and with silver,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.8'>Then the chief of the families of Judea and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and all they whose mind the Lord had moved to go up, and to build an house for the Lord at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.9'>And they that dwelt round about them, and helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many free gifts of a great number whose minds were stirred up thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.10'>King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in his temple of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.11'>Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth, he delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.12'>And by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.13'>And this was the number of them; A thousand golden cups, and a thousand of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of gold thirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten, and a thousand other vessels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.26'>I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me: therefore I commanded to make diligent search, and it hath been found that that city was from the beginning practising against kings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.27'>And the men therein were given to rebellion and war: and that mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tributes in Celosyria and Phenice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.28'>Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be no more done in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.29'>And that those wicked workers proceed no further to the annoyance of kings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.2.30'>Then king Artaxerxes his letters being read, Rathumus, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them, removing in haste toward Jerusalem with a troop of horsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Esd.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.1'>Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.2'>And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.3'>And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.4'>Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king’s body, spake one to another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.5'>Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.6'>As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.7'>And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.8'>And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.9'>And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.10'>The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.11'>The second wrote, The king is strongest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.12'>The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.13'>Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.14'>And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.15'>And sat him down in the royal seat of judgement; and the writings were read before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.16'>And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.17'>And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.18'>And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.19'>It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.20'>It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.21'>And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.22'>And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.23'>But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.3.24'>O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Esd.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.1'>Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.2'>O ye men, do not men excel in strength that bear rule over sea and land and all things in them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.3'>But yet the king is more mighty: for he is lord of all these things, and hath dominion over them; and whatsoever he commandeth them they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.4'>If he bid them make war the one against the other, they do it: if he send them out against the enemies, they go, and break down mountains walls and towers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.5'>They slay and are slain, and transgress not the king’s commandment: if they get the victory, they bring all to the king, as well the spoil, as all things else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.6'>Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to do with wars, but use husbandry, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel one another to pay tribute unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.7'>And yet he is but one man: if he command to kill, they kill; if he command to spare, they spare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.8'>If he command to smite, they smite; if he command to make desolate, they make desolate; if he command to build, they build;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.9'>If he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command to plant, they plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.10'>So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore he lieth down, he eateth and drinketh, and taketh his rest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.11'>And these keep watch round about him, neither may any one depart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him in any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.12'>O ye men, how should not the king be mightiest, when in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.13'>Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of the truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.14'>O ye men, it is not the great king, nor the multitude of men, neither is it wine, that excelleth; who is it then that ruleth them, or hath the lordship over them? are they not women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.15'>Women have borne the king and all the people that bear rule by sea and land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.16'>Even of them came they: and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards, from whence the wine cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.17'>These also make garments for men; these bring glory unto men; and without women cannot men be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.18'>Yea, and if men have gathered together gold and silver, or any other goodly thing, do they not love a woman which is comely in favour and beauty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.19'>And letting all those things go, do they not gape, and even with open mouth fix their eyes fast on her; and have not all men more desire unto her than unto silver or gold, or any goodly thing whatsoever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.20'>A man leaveth his own father that brought him up, and his own country, and cleaveth unto his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.21'>He sticketh not to spend his life with his wife. and remembereth neither father, nor mother, nor country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.22'>By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you: do ye not labour and toil, and give and bring all to the woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.23'>Yea, a man taketh his sword, and goeth his way to rob and to steal, to sail upon the sea and upon rivers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.24'>And looketh upon a lion, and goeth in the darkness; and when he hath stolen, spoiled, and robbed, he bringeth it to his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.25'>Wherefore a man loveth his wife better than father or mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.26'>Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become servants for their sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.27'>Many also have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.28'>And now do ye not believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to touch him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.29'>Yet did I see him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.30'>And taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.31'>And yet for all this the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if she took any displeasure at him, the king was fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to him again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.32'>O ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.33'>Then the king and the princes looked one upon another: so he began to speak of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.34'>O ye men, are not women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in his course, for he compasseth the heavens round about, and fetcheth his course again to his own place in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.35'>Is he not great that maketh these things? therefore great is the truth, and stronger than all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.36'>All the earth crieth upon the truth, and the heaven blesseth it: all works shake and tremble at it, and with it is no unrighteous thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.37'>Wine is wicked, the king is wicked, women are wicked, all the children of men are wicked, and such are all their wicked works; and there is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness also they shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.38'>As for the truth, it endureth, and is Always strong; it liveth and conquereth for evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.39'>With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but she doeth the things that are just, and refraineth from all unjust and wicked things; and all men do well like of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.40'>Neither in her judgement is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, kingdom, power, and majesty, of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.41'>And with that he held his peace. And all the people then shouted, and said, Great is Truth, and mighty above all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.42'>Then said the king unto him, Ask what thou wilt more than is appointed in the writing, and we will give it thee, because thou art found wisest; and thou shalt sit next me, and shalt be called my cousin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.43'>Then said he unto the king, Remember thy vow, which thou hast vowed to build Jerusalem, in the day when thou camest to thy kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.44'>And to send away all the vessels that were taken away out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and to send them again thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.45'>Thou also hast vowed to build up the temple, which the Edomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.46'>And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, and which I desire of thee, and this is the princely liberality proceeding from thyself: I desire therefore that thou make good the vow, the performance whereof with thine own mouth thou hast vowed to the King of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.47'>Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wrote letters for him unto all the treasurers and lieutenants and captains and governors, that they should safely convey on their way both him, and all those that go up with him to build Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.48'>He wrote letters also unto the lieutenants that were in Celosyria and Phenice, and unto them in Libanus, that they should bring cedar wood from Libanus unto Jerusalem, and that they should build the city with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.49'>Moreover he wrote for all the Jews that went out of his realm up into Jewry, concerning their freedom, that no officer, no ruler, no lieutenant, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.50'>And that all the country which they hold should be free without tribute; and that the Edomites should give over the villages of the Jews which then they held:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.51'>Yea, that there should be yearly given twenty talents to the building of the temple, until the time that it were built;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.52'>And other ten talents yearly, to maintain the burnt offerings upon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to offer seventeen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.53'>And that all they that went from Babylon to build the city should have free liberty, as well they as their posterity, and all the priests that went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.54'>He wrote also concerning. the charges, and the priests’ vestments wherein they minister;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.55'>And likewise for the charges of the Levites, to be given them until the day that the house were finished, and Jerusalem builded up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.56'>And he commanded to give to all that kept the city pensions and wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.57'>He sent away also all the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrus had set apart; and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, the same charged he also to be done, and sent unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.58'>Now when this young man was gone forth, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.59'>And said, From thee cometh victory, from thee cometh wisdom, and thine is the glory, and I am thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.60'>Blessed art thou, who hast given me wisdom: for to thee I give thanks, O Lord of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.61'>And so he took the letters, and went out, and came unto Babylon, and told it all his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.62'>And they praised the God of their fathers, because he had given them freedom and liberty</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.4.63'>To go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which is called by his name: and they feasted with instruments of musick and gladness seven days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.50'>And there were gathered unto them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected the altar upon his own place, because all the nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed them; and they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.51'>Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and offered sacrifices daily, as was meet:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.55'>Unto them of Zidon also and Tyre they gave carrs, that they should bring cedar trees from Libanus, which should be brought by floats to the haven of Joppa, according as it was commanded them by Cyrus king of the Persians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.56'>And in the second year and second month after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem began Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and their brethren, and the priests, and the Levites, and all they that were come unto Jerusalem out of the captivity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.57'>And they laid the foundation of the house of God in the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.58'>And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord.

So the workmen built the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.59'>And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets; and the Levites the sons of Asaph had cymbals,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.61'>And they sung with loud voices songs to the praise of the Lord, because his mercy and glory is for ever in all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.62'>And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.63'>Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of their families, the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of this with weeping and great crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.64'>But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.65'>Insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weeping of the people: yet the multitude sounded marvellously, so that it was heard afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.66'>Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets should mean.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.68'>So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of the families, and said unto them, We will build together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.69'>For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.5.73'>And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.11'>Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandment build ye this house, and lay the foundations of these works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.12'>Therefore to the intent that we might give knowledge unto thee by writing, we demanded of them who were the chief doers, and we required of them the names in writing of their principal men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.13'>So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lord which made heaven and earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.14'>And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by a king of Israel great and strong, and was finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.15'>But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinned against the Lord of Israel which is in heaven, he gave them over into the power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of the Chaldees;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.23'>Then commanded king Darius to seek among the records at Babylon: and so at Ecbatana the palace, which is in the country of Media, there was found a roll wherein these things were recorded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.24'>In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded that the house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be built again, where they do sacrifice with continual fire:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.27'>And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those which were appointed rulers in Syria and Phenice, should be careful not to meddle with the place, but suffer Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, to build the house of the Lord in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.28'>I have commanded also to have it built up whole again; and that they look diligently to help those that be of the captivity of the Jews, till the house of the Lord be finished:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.29'>And out of the tribute of Celosyria and Phenice a portion carefully to be given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, that is, to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.30'>And also corn, salt, wine, and oil, and that continually every year without further question, according as the priests that be in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.6.33'>The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterly destroy every king and nation, that stretcheth out his hand to hinder or endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.59'>Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chief of the priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.60'>So the priests and the Levites, who had received the silver and the gold and the vessels, brought them unto Jerusalem, into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.61'>And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord, which was with us: and from the beginning of our journey the Lord delivered us from every enemy, and so we came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.62'>And when we had been there three days, the gold and silver that was weighed was delivered in the house of our Lord on the fourth day unto Marmoth the priest the son of Iri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.63'>And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them were Josabad the son of Jesu and Moeth the son of Sabban, Levites: all was delivered them by number and weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.64'>And all the weight of them was written up the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.65'>Moreover they that were come out of the captivity offered sacrifice unto the Lord God of Israel, even twelve bullocks for all Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.66'>Threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering, twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.67'>And they delivered the king’s commandments unto the king’s stewards’ and to the governors of Celosyria and Phenice; and they honoured the people and the temple of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.68'>Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.69'>The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, Hittites, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.70'>For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the great men have been partakers of this iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.71'>And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes, and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and very heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.72'>So all they that were then moved at the word of the Lord God of Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.73'>Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and the holy garment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands unto the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.74'>I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed before thy face;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.75'>For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our ignorances have reached up unto heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.76'>For ever since the time of our fathers we have been and are in great sin, even unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.77'>And for our sins and our fathers’ we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.78'>And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed unto us from thee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of thy sanctuary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.79'>And to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.80'>Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.81'>Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in Jewry and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.82'>And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? for we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.83'>That the land, which ye enter into to possess as an heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.84'>Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto their sons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.85'>Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with them, that ye may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that ye may leave the inheritance of the land unto your children for evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.86'>And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked works and great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.87'>And didst give unto us such a root: but we have turned back again to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with the uncleanness of the nations of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.88'>Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed, nor name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.89'>O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.90'>Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer by reason of these things before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.91'>And as Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and women and children: for there was great weeping among the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.92'>Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the nations of the land, and now is all Israel aloft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.93'>Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will put away all our wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.94'>Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do obey the law of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.95'>Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth this matter appertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.8.96'>So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and so they sware.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Esd.9'>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.1'>Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.2'>And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.3'>And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all them that were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.4'>And that whosoever met not there within two or three days according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from them that were of the captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.5'>And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of the ninth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.6'>And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of the temple because of the present foul weather.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.7'>So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sins of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.8'>And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.9'>And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.10'>Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.11'>But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.12'>Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.13'>And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.14'>Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.15'>And they that were of the captivity did according to all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.16'>And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men of their families, all by name: and in the first day of the tenth month they sat together to examine the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.17'>So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end in the first day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.18'>And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.19'>Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.20'>And they gave their hands to put away their wives and to offer rams to make reconcilement for their errors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.21'>And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes, and Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.22'>And of the sons of Phaisur; Elionas, Massias Israel, and Nathanael, and Ocidelus and Talsas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.23'>And of the Levites; Jozabad, and Semis, and Colius, who was called Calitas, and Patheus, and Judas, and Jonas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.24'>Of the holy singers; Eleazurus, Bacchurus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.25'>Of the porters; Sallumus, and Tolbanes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.26'>Of them of Israel, of the sons of Phoros; Hiermas, and Eddias, and Melchias, and Maelus, and Eleazar, and Asibias, and Baanias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.27'>Of the sons of Ela; Matthanias, Zacharias, and Hierielus, and Hieremoth, and Aedias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.28'>And of the sons of Zamoth; Eliadas, Elisimus, Othonias, Jarimoth, and Sabatus, and Sardeus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.29'>Of the sons of Babai; Johannes, and Ananias and Josabad, and Amatheis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.30'>Of the sons of Mani; Olamus, Mamuchus, Jedeus, Jasubus, Jasael, and Hieremoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.31'>And of the sons of Addi; Naathus, and Moosias, Lacunus, and Naidus, and Mathanias, and Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.32'>And of the sons of Annas; Elionas and Aseas, and Melchias, and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.33'>And of the sons of Asom; Altaneus, and Matthias, and Baanaia, Eliphalet, and Manasses, and Semei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.34'>And of the sons of Maani; Jeremias, Momdis, Omaerus, Juel, Mabdai, and Pelias, and Anos, Carabasion, and Enasibus, and Mamnitanaimus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Samis, Selemias, Nathanias: and of the sons of Ozora; Sesis, Esril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambis, Josephus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.35'>And of the sons of Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias, Edes, Juel, Banaias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.36'>All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.37'>And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of the seventh month: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.38'>And the whole multitude came together with one accord into the broad place of the holy porch toward the east:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.39'>And they spake unto Esdras the priest and reader, that he would bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.40'>So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto the whole multitude from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear law in the first day of the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.41'>And he read in the broad court before the holy porch from morning unto midday, before both men and women; and the multitude gave heed unto the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.42'>And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon a pulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.43'>And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.44'>And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus, and Nabarias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.45'>Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude: for he sat honourably in the first place in the sight of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.46'>And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts, Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.47'>And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.48'>Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas, Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas, Azarias, and Joazabdus, and Ananias, Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.49'>Then spake Attharates unto Esdras the chief priest. and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.50'>This day is holy unto the Lord; (for they all wept when they heard the law:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.51'>Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send part to them that have nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.52'>For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.53'>So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.54'>Then went they their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give part to them that had nothing, and to make great cheer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Esd.9.55'>Because they understood the words wherein they were instructed, and for the which they had been assembled.</verse>
