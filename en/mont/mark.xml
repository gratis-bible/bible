  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>Beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>even as it is written in the prophet Isaiah, Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face to prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying aloud. In the desert make ready a road for the Lord. Make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>In the desert came Johnwho baptized, and preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>and all the land of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem, kept going out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan river,  confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And Johnwas clothed with camels hair, and he had a leather girdle round his loins, and he ate locusts, and "honey of the wood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He made proclamation. "There is One mightier than I coming after me,  and I am not worthy to stoop down and unfasten his sandal strap;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you in water, but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>It was at that time that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by Johnin the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>and as soon as he rose from the water he saw the sky cleft asunder,  and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and a voice from the sky. "Thou art my Son, my beloved; in thee is my delight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Then the Spirit drove him at once into the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>and he remained in the desert for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was among the wild beasts, but the angels were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>After Johnhad been thrown into prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>"The time is now come," he said, "and the kingdom of God is near!  Repent and believe the gospel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And as he was passing along by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew, Simons brother, casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>so Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>As he went a little farther on he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and Johnhis brother, who also were in their boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Straightway he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>So they came to Capernaum, and as soon as the Sabbath Day came he went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>They were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them with authority, not like the Scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And at that very moment, there in their synagogue, a man in the grip of an unclean spirit shrieked out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>"What business have you with us, you Jesus of Nazareth? Are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying. "Be quit! Come out of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>So the unclean spirit, after tearing him, came out of him with a loud cry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>and every one was amazed so that they began questioning among themselves. "What does this mean? A new teaching with authority? He lays commands even upon unclean spirits and they obey him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And at once his fame spread everywhere through that part of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>On leaving the synagogue they went at once with Jamesand Johnto the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simons mother-in-law lay sick of fever, and without delay they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>So he came and took her hand and raised her up. The fever left her at once, and she began to wait upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>At evening when the sun had set, people came and brought to him all the sick and demon-possessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the whole town was gathered at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>He cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>In the morning he rose a great while before day and went out to a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and his companions hunted him up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and told him, "Every one is looking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>"Let us go away," he answered, "to the neighboring country towns,  that I may preach there, too; because for that purpose I came forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>One day a leper cane to him and besought him as he knelt down to him, saying, "If you choose, you are able to cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him,  saying, "I do choose, be clean!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>The leprosy at once left him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Jesus immediately sent him away, charging him sternly and saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>"See you say nothing to any one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded for a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to tell every one and to publish it broadcast, so that Jesus could no longer enter any town openly; but he had to remain outside in lonely places, and people kept coming to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>Some days later when Jesus entered Capernaum again the news spread,  "He is in the house";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>and at once such a crowd gathered that there was no longer room for them, even around the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>While he was speaking his message, they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>When they could not get him near to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof under which he stood, and after making an opening,  they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Then Jesus, when he perceived their faith, said to the paralytic,  "Son your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there were some Scribes sitting there who reasoned in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>"Why does this man speak like this? He blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins but One, God himself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Jesus clearly perceived at once be the Spirit that they were thus reasoning in their hearts and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>"Why do you reason thus in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your cot and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But to let you see that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins" -he said to the paralytic-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>"I bid you rise, take up your cot, and go home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>The man rose, at once took up his cot, and went out before them all;  at which they were all astounded, and gave God glory, saying, "We never saw anything like this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Then Jesus went again to the seaside, and the whole crowd kept coming to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he was passing by he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax-office; and he said to him, "Follow me." So he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Later on Levi was sitting at table in his house, and together with Jesus and his disciples a number of tax-gatherers and sinners were guests, for there were many of them who used to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>But when some scribes of the Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax-gatherers, they said to his disciples, "Is he eating and drinking with tax-gatherers and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>On hearing this Jesus said to them. "It is not the healthy who need a physician, but the sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees were keeping a fast, and people came to ask him, "How is it that the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees are fasting, but your disciples are not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>"Can friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them?"  asked Jesus. "As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then, on that day, they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth onto an old garment,  otherwise the patch tears away from it - the new from the old - and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one ever pours new wine into old wine-skins, else the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine is poured into fresh wine-skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>One Sabbath he was walking along through the wheat-fields, and his disciples, as they began to make their way across, were pulling the heads of wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>"Look," said the Pharisees to him, "Why are they doing on the Sabbath Day what is against the law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>He answered them. "Have you never read what David did when he was needy and hungry, he and his men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which none but priests may eat, and gave some to his men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>"The Sabbath," he told them, "was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so the Son of man is Master even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>Again he went into a synagogue where there was a man with his hand withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they kept watching Jesus to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath; so as to have some charge to bring against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>"Stand up," Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "and come forward."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he asked them. "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath Day, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>They were silent. Then looking around upon them with anger, and deeply grieved by the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man,  "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and the hand was at once completely restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>As soon as they came out, the Pharisees plotted against him with the Herodians, in order to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Then Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great crowd of people from Galilee followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>From Judea, too, and Jerusalem, and Idumea, and from beyond Jordan,  and from the district of Tyre and Sidon, they came to him a vast multitude, because they heard what he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>So he directed his disciples to keep a little boat in readiness for him, because of the crowd, to prevent their crushing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed so many that all the people who had ailments pressed upon him so as to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they threw themselves down at his feet, screaming out, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But over and over, he strictly forbade them to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Then he went up the hillside and called to him those whom he chose,  and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>Twelve of them whom he also called "Apostles," he appointed to be with him, and also that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>There was Simon, whom he surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James(them he surnamed Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas,  and Jamesthe son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>Then he went into a house, but again such a multitude assembled that they could not get their food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his relatives heard of it, they came to take possession of him,  for they said, "He is out of his mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The Scribes also who had come down from Jerusalem, said, "He is Beelzebub," and, "He casts out demons by the power of the Prince of the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>So when he had called them to him he spoke to them in parables.  "How," said he, "can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>if a household be divided against itself, that household cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>and if Satan has revolted against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand. Nay, he meets his end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>"Indeed, no one can enter the strong mans house and carry off his property without first binding the strong man; then he can plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>In solemn truth I tell you that the sons of men shall be forgiven all their sins and all the blasphemies they may utter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit is never forgiven.  Nay, he is in the grasp of an eternal sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they kept saying, "He has an unclean spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then his mother and his brothers came up, and standing outside, they sent a messenger to him to call him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>Now a crowd was sitting round him and they told him, "See! your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, wanting to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Then, with a glance at those who were in the circle sitting around him, he added.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God,  that one is my brother and sister and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Afterwards Jesus began to teach by the seaside, and a vast multitude of people gathered about him, so that he went on board a boat on the sea, and sat there, while all the people stayed on shore, at the waters edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>Then he began teaching them in parables many things. In his teaching he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>"Listen! the Sower once went out to sow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and as he sowed, it happened that some seed fell on the road, and birds came and picked it up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>some other seed fell on stony soil, where it had not much earth; and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>but when the sun rose it was scorched and withered away because it had no root.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it, so that it yielded no crop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But some seed fell into good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up and increased, yielding thirty, sixty, or a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>"Any one who has ears to hear," he added, "let him listen to this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When he was alone his followers and the Twelve began asking about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He went on to say to them. "The secret truth concerning the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside everything is told in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that, "for all their looking they may not see, and for all their hearing, they may not understand, lest perchance they should turn and be pardoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>"You do not understand this parable," said Jesus. "Then how will you understand the other parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>"What the Sower sows is the Word. There are those on the wayside  where the Word is sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>As soon as they hear it, Satan immediately comes and snatches away the Word which has been sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And like the sowing upon stony ground are those who, whenever they hear the Word, at once receive it with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but because they have no root in themselves they last for a time;  but when suffering or persecution ensues because of the Word, they at once fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>There are others who are sown among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>When they have heard the Word, the anxieties of life and the snares of wealth, and all sorts of other ambitions, come in to choke the Word, so that it proves unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>But those, on the other hand, who were sown on that good soil, are those who listen to the Word, and welcome it, and bear fruit, thirty,  sixty, or a hundredfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>He went on to say. "Is the lamp brought in to be put under the bushel or the bed? Is it not rather to be put on the lamp-stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>There is nothing hidden except what is to be disclosed, and nothing concealed except what is to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them. "Take heed what you hear. With what measure you measure it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he who holds, to him will more be given, and he who holds not,  from him will be taken even what he holds." "It is with the kingdom of God," he continued, "as if a man should have sown seed in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>night and day he sleeps and wakes while the seed is sprouting and growing tall, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>Of its own accord the earth bears its crops; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>Then as soon as the crop is ready the man has the sickle put in at once, because harvest-time is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>"To what shall we compare the kingdom of God?" he said again. "in what parable shall we set it forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard-seed, which, when sown in the soil, is the smallest seed in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet when sown shoots up and becomes larger than any plant, sending out such branches that the wild birds build their nests under its shadow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such illustrations Jesus used to tell his message to people as far as they were able to receive it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>and to them it was his practice never to speak except in parables.  But he used to explain everything in private to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On the evening of that same day Jesus said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them just as he was in the boat; and the other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>But a great gale of wind came up, and the waves were dashing into the boat so that it began to fill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>Now he himself was sleeping on the cushion in the stern, so they woke him up, saying, "Master, do you not care if we perish?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he awoke, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace, be still!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>The wind fell, and there ensued a great calm. Then he said to them.  "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>Then they were awestruck, and said one to another, "Who can this be,  that even the wind and the sea obey him!"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>Then they came to the country of the Gadarenes, on the opposite side of the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>and he had no sooner stepped out of the boat, than a man out of the tombs came to meet him, a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who lived among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>Not even with a chain could any man bind him, for he had been bound with fetters and chains again and again, and had snapped the chains,  and broken the fetters; and there was no one strong enough to master him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he remained among the tombs and in the mountains, shrieking and gashing himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>As he caught sight of Jesus from afar, he ran and knelt before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and with a shriek he cried out in a loud voice. "Jesus, son of God most high, what business have you with me? I adjure you by God,  torment me not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For Jesus was saying, "Foul spirit, come out of the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>He continued asking him, "What is your mane?" "Legion is my name,  for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>Over and over he continued to beg Jesus not to send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was on the hillside a great drove of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>So the spirits begged him, saying, "Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And he gave them leave. And out came the foul spirits and entered the swine; and the drove rushed down from the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand, and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>On this the swineherds ran away and spread the news in town and country. So the people went to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>When they got to Jesus they found the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind - the man who had had the "Legion" - and they were awestruck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had been eye-witnesses told them what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then they began to beg Jesus to depart from their district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging to go with him; but he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>"Go home to your own people, and tell them what great things God has done for you, and has had mercy upon you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>So he went and began to publish abroad in the District of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and every one was astonished and all men marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Then after Jesus had recrossed in a boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding around him; so he stayed on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Then one of the wardens of the synagogue, named Jairus, came up, and as soon as he saw Jesus, fell at his feet, with many entreaties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>"My little daughter," he said, "is dying. I beseech you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may recover and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>So he went with him, and a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>Now there was a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, but was no better; on the contrary, rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>She had heard about Jesus, so she came in the crowd behind and touched his cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>"If I can touch even his clothes," she kept saying to herself, "I shall get well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>At once the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was cured of her complaint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Jesus, instantly conscious that the power within him had gone forth,  turned about in the crowd, and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>"You see the crowd thronging about you," said his disciples, "and yet you say, Who touched me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>But he kept looking about to see who had done it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>and the woman knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>"Daughter," he said, "your faith has saved you. Go in peace, and be cured of your complaint."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking men came from the house of the warden of the synagogue to tell him, "Your daughter is dead, why trouble the Teacher any further?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, paying no attention to the remark, said to the warden of the synagogue, "Have no fear, only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>He would not permit any one to go with him, except Peter and Jamesand John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>As they came to the house of the warden of the synagogue, he gazed upon a tumult, many weeping and wailing shrilly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>"Why all this tumult and loud weeping?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>"The child is not dead, but asleep." And they began to laugh him to scorn. Then he put them all outside, took the father and mother of the child and those he brought with him, and entered the room where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>Then he took the childs hand and said to her, "Talitha, cumi," that is to say, "Little girl, I am speaking to you; arise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And instantly the little girl stood up, and began to walk, for she was twelve years old, They were at once beside themselves with utter amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>He, however, repeatedly cautioned them not to let any one know about it, and directed them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Jesus left that place, and accompanied by his disciples, came into his own part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>When it came Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; many, as they listened, were deeply impressed. "Where did he get all this?"  they asked; "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, and miracles such as these that happen at his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of Jamesand Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>So they disapproved of him. Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his native land and among his relatives and in his home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he was unable to do any miracle there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he wondered at their lack of faith. So he went among the neighboring villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>Then summoning the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He bade them take nothing but a staff for their journey; no bread,  no wallet, no coins in their purse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>they were to wear sandals, but not to put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>"Wherever you enter a house," he told them, "remain there until you leave the place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>and if any place does not receive you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust under your feet, as a warning to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>So they fared forth and summoned men to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>They cast out many demons, and anointed many sick people with oil and cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard it, for the name of Jesus had become well known,  People were saying, "Johnthe Baptist is risen from the dead, and on that account these powers are working in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>"He is Elijah," said others. And still others were saying, "He is a prophet, like one of the old prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard, he said, "That Johnwhom I beheaded has come back to life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>Now this Herod had sent and arrested John, and bound him in prison,  for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife, whom he had married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For Johnhad often told Herod, "It is not right for you to live with your brothers wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>So Herodias hated him, and wished to put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>but she could not, for Herod was afraid of Johnbecause he knew that he was a just and holy man. So he kept him safe. When he listened to Johnhe was much exercised, yet he found pleasure in listening to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>Then came a convenient day, when Herod on his birthday held a feast for his lords and generals and the leading men of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>at which the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced. She charmed Herod and his guests. "Ask me whatever you want," said the king to the young girl, "and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He even swore to her that whatever she asked, he would give it to her, up to half his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>So she came out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of Johnthe Baptist," she replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>So she at once hurried in to the king and made her request, "I want you," she said, "to give me, without delay, the head of Johnthe Baptist on a charger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>Then the king was exceedingly sorry; yet on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to disappoint her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>So he sent at once a soldier of the guard with orders to bring his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>And he went and beheaded Johnin prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young girl, and she gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When Johns disciples heard of this, they came, and took his body,  and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>When the apostles had come back to Jesus, they told him all the things they had done, and all they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>Then he said to them, "Come apart, yourselves, to a quiet spot, and rest a while." For there were many coming and going, and they could not get time even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>So they sailed away privately to a solitary place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>However, many saw them going, and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the neighboring towns, and arrived there first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>So when Jesus landed he saw a vast multitude, and he was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd,  and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>Then when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him and said. "This place is desert, and the day is now far spent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send the people away so that they may go to the farms and villages about here, and buy themselves something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>In answer he said to them, "You yourselves are to give them food."  "Are we to go and buy fifty dollars worth of bread," they said, "and give them food?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>"How many loaves have you?" he answered. "Go and see." When they had found out, they said, "Five, and two fishes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then he directed them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they sat down like beds in a garden, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven he blessed, broke the loaves in pieces, and kept giving to the disciples to distribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>The two fish also he divided to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>All ate and had enough; and they carried away broken fragments of bread and of fish, enough to fill twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Those who ate the bread were five thousand adult men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Then he at once compelled the disciples to embark in the boat and go before him to Bethsaida on the other side, while he sent the people away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>After he had taken leave of them, he went away into the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening came, the boat was half-way across the sea, while he was on shore alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>but when he saw them distressed in rowing (for the wind was against them), about the fourth watch of the night he went to them, walking upon the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>they thought it was an apparition and shrieked aloud, for they all saw him and were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>But he at once spoke with them, saying. "Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then he got into the boat beside them, and the wind ceased, and they were utterly astounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they had not understood about the loaves; on the contrary their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>When they had crossed over they landed at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>As soon as they got out of the boat, the people at once recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and began running over that whole country, and carrying the sick about on their beds, wherever they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And whenever he entered into villages or cities or the fields they would lay the sick in the market-places and beseech him to let them touch even the tassel of his cloak, and all who touched him were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>One day the Pharisees came to him in a body with some Scribes who had come from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>They had noticed that some of his disciples were eating with "common," that is to say, unwashed hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat until they have ceremoniously washed their hands in obedience to the tradition of the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and when they come from the market-place they do not eat without bathing first. and they have many other customs which they have received and observe, such as the washing of cups and jugs and copper pans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>So the Pharisees and Scribes asked him. "Why do your disciples not follow the traditions of the elders? Why do they eat with common  unwashed hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>"Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, hypocrites," he answered. "As it is written, "This people honor me with their lips, While their hearts are far from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>But in vain do they worship me, For their teaching is only human precepts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>"You neglect the commandment of God, and hold fast the traditions of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>"It is praiseworthy, is it," he exclaimed, "to reject the command of God that you may keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For although Moses said, Honor your father and mother, and Let him who curses father or mother suffer death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>you say that if a man tells his father or mother, This money which otherwise you would have received from me, is Korban (that is, a thing devoted to God),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>you exempt him from doing any service for his father or mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>Thus by your tradition which you have handed down you set at naught the word of God; and you do many other things like that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>Then again he called the crowd to him and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>"Listen to me, all of you, and understand; there is nothing outside a man which by entering in can defile him; but it is what comes from him that defiled him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>After he had left the crowd and gone indoors his disciples began asking him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>"Are even you without understanding?" he said. "Do you not perceive that nothing whatever from without can defile a man by entering him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and passes away, ejected from him?" By these words he pronounced all foods clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>"What comes out of a man," he continued, "is what defiles him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>From within, from the heart of man, proceed evil purposes -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>fornication, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit,  wantonness, envy, slander, arrogance, reckless folly -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>all these wicked things issue from within and defile a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>After he rose and left that place, he went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. Here he went into a house and wished no one to know it but he could not be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>(the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race), and again and again she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>"Let the children be filled first," he said to her. "It is unseemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>"True, Master," she answered, "but the dogs under the table do pick up the childrens crumbs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>"For that saying of yours, go home," he replied; "the demon has departed from your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>So she went home, and found the child lying in her bed and the demon departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Again he left the region of Tyre, and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, crossing the District of the Ten Towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And they brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hands upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>So Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put his finger in the mans ears, and moistened his tongue with saliva;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>then looking up to heaven with a sigh, he said to him, "Ephphatha!"  (that is, "Be opened.")</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened,  and he spoke plainly. Then Jesus charged them not to tell any one,  but the more he charged them, the more they published it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>and people were amazed beyond measure saying. "How successfully he does things! Even the deaf he makes to hear, and the dumb to speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days when a large crowd had again assembled and had nothing to eat, Jesus called together his disciples and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>"My heart aches for the crowd, because they have remained with me three days now, and they have nothing to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>and if I send them away fasting to their homes, they will faint on the way. Moreover, some of them are from a distance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>"Where will it be possible," answered his disciples, "for one to fill these men with bread in a lonely place like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them, "How many loaves have you?" "Seven," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>So he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground; and when he had taken the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave to his disciples to distribute to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They had also a few small fish; after blessing these he told his disciples to distribute them also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>They ate and were filled and they took up of broken pieces that were left, seven hampers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>They that had eaten were about four thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>Then he sent them away, got at once into the boat with his disciples. and came into the district of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, by way of testing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>At this Jesus sighed deeply in his spirit, and said. "Why does the present generation seek a sign? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign shall be given this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>Then he left them, and getting into the boat again, went away to the other side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now they had forgotten to take bread, and had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>So he gave them this warning. "Look out! Be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they began arguing with one another because they had no bread,  He noted this and said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>"Why are you arguing together because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive and understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Are your minds so slow to comprehend? You have eyes, do you not see?  You have ears, do you not hear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>Do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces did you take up?"  "Twelve," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>"And when the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did you pick up?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>"Do you not yet understand?" he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>Then they came to Bethsaida, where some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>Taking the blind man by the hand, he led him outside the village;  and, after spitting on his eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked,  "Can you make out anything?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>The man looked up and said, "I can make out the people, for as they move about, I see them like trees."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then Jesus again put his hands on the mans eyes; and the man,  staring straight ahead, recovered his sight and continued to see everything perfectly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Then Jesus sent him home, saying, "Do not even go into the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>From there Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he began to question his disciples saying,  "Who do people say I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>And they told him. "Some say Johnthe Baptist, others, Elijah, and others that you are one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>And he continued questioning them, "But you yourselves, Who do you say I am?" Peter in reply said to him, "You are Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Then he strictly charged them not to say this about him to any one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>and he began to explain to them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests, and the Scribes, and be put to death,and after two days rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>This he told them quite openly. Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But he turned round, and looked upon his disciples, and rebuked Peter. "Get thee behind me, Satan," he said, "for your thoughts are not Gods thoughts, but mans."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>Then summoning the crowd to him, with his disciples. he said. "If any man wishes to follow me, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and so follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever, for my sake and the gospels, loses his life will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>"In solemn truth I tell you," he said, "there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God, come with power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days later Jesus took with him Peter and Jamesand John, and brought them by themselves up a high mountain apart from the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>Here in their presence he was transfigured; and his clothes also became glistering with a radiant whiteness, such as no bleaching on earth could give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Moreover there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>"Master," said Peter, addressing Jesus, "it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three tents one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>(For he did not know what to say, they were so awestruck.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>Then there came a cloud overshadowing them; and there came a voice out of the cloud. "This is my Son, my beloved. Listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly as they looked around, they saw no one any more beside them, but Jesus alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>As they came down the mountain he strictly forbade them to narrate to any one what they had seen, until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>This order they faithfully kept, questioning among themselves what "rising again from the dead" meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>So they asked him, "How is it that the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>"Elijah does indeed first come," he said, "and restores all things,  But how is it written about the Son of Man, that he will endure great suffering, and be rejected?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>"Elijah indeed has already come," he added, "and they have done to him whatever they pleased, even as it is written of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>When they rejoined the disciples they saw a great crowd surrounding them, and some Scribes disputing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>As soon as they saw him, all the people were astounded and ran up to greet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>He asked them, "What are you discussing with them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>"Master," answered one of the crowd, "I brought my son to you; he has a dumb spirit in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and wherever it seizes him it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and is wasting away. I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>"O unbelieving generation!" replied Jesus; "how long must I be with you? How long must I be patient with you? Bring him to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>So they brought the boy to him, and when he saw Jesus, the spirit at once convulsed him, and he fell to the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Then Jesus asked the father, "How long has he been like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>"From childhood," he answered; "and often it has thrown him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything,  take pity on us and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him. "If you can!All things can be for one who believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>The boys father with a cry said instantly. "I do believe; help my unbelief."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit. "You dumb and deaf spirit," he said, "come out of him, I command you, and never enter him again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>So with a loud shriek it came out, after throwing the boy into convulsion after convulsion. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>When Jesus had gone into the house, his disciples asked him in private, "Why could not we cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>"This kind can only be cast out by prayer," he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Jesus and his disciples, after leaving that place, passed through Galilee; but he was unwilling that any one should know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for he was explaining to his disciples that the Son of man was to be betrayed into the hands of men, and that they would put him to death,  but that after he had been put to death, he would rise again after three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand his words, and were afraid to ask him the meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>Then they came to Capernaum; and when he got into the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the road?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent, for on the road they were disputing together which one was greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>So he sat down and called the Twelve, and said to them, "If any one wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and the servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>Then Jesus took a little child, set it among them, and folding it in his arms, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>"Whoever in my name receives one such little child, receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me, but Him who sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>"Master," said John, "we saw a man casting out demons in your name,  and we tried to stop him because he did not follow us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>"Do not try to stop him," Jesus answered, "for there is no one who performs a miracle in my name who can soon speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>He who is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>For whoever gives you even a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, in solemn truth I tell you, that he shall certainly not lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>"And if any one shall cause one of these little ones who believe on me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown out into the sea with a great millstone about his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>"If your hand cause you to stumble, cut it off! It is better to be maimed and to enter into life than to have two hands and go away into hell, into the fire that cannot be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>If your foot cause you to stumble, cut it off! It is better to enter into the life a cripple, than to have two feet and be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>If your eye cause you to stumble, tear it out! It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God one-eyed that to keep both your eyes and be cast into hell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>where their worm never dies and the fire does not go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>For by fire every one will be salted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>salt is excellent, but if the salt has lost its savor, what will you use to restore its saltness? Then have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>On leaving that place Jesus came into the borders of Judea, on the other side of the Jordan, Once more the people flocked about him, and again, as usual, he began teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>Presently some Pharisees came up and tested him, by asking if it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>"What did Moses command you?" he replied,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>"Moses," said they, "permitted a man to draw up a bill of separation and divorce her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>But Jesus said to them. "Moses gave you that command because of the hardness of your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>"For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>When indoors the disciples began to question Jesus again about this,  and he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>"Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>and if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>Now people were bringing little children to Jesus for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>Jesus was indignant when he saw it, and said. "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>I tell you true that unless a man receives the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not even enter it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>Then he took them in his arms, and laid his hand upon them in blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>As he started to go forth into the road, a man came running up to him, and knelt down before him. "Good Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>Jesus said to him. "Why do you call me good?No one is good save one, God himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the commandments. Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat, honor your father and mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>"Teacher," he answered, "I have observed all these from my youth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Jesus loved him as he looked at him, and said. "One thing you lack.  Go, sell all you have and give to the poor; and you shall have wealth in heaven; and come, follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>But his face fell at these words, and he went away saddened, for he was one who had great wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Then Jesus looked round on his disciples and said, "How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus looked around and said again to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>"My sons, how hard it is for those who trust in money to enter the kingdom of God. It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>"Then who can be saved?" they said to themselves astonished beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>When he had looked at them, Jesus said, "With men it is impossible,  but not with God, for all things are possible with God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>"But we," Peter began to say, "we have left our all and have followed you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.29'>"I tell you solemnly," said Jesus, "that there is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospels,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.31'>But many who are first shall be last, and the last, first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus led the way; and they were amazed, and some, although they followed, were afraid. Then once more he took the Twelve, and began to tell them what was about to befall him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>"See," said he, "we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be betrayed to the high priests and the Scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.34'>who will mock him, spit upon him, flog him, and put him to death;  and after three days he will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>Presently there came up to him Jamesand John, the sons of Zebedee,  and said, "Teacher, we wish you would do for us whatever we ask you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>"What is it you want me to do for you?" said he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>They answered, "Allow us to sit, one at your right hand, and the other at your left hand, in your glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>"You know not what you are asking," said Jesus. "Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>They answered him, "We can." "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>but a seat upon my right hand or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been reserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>When they heard this the ten began to be indignant at Jamesand John,  so Jesus called them to him and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>"You know that those who are regarded as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones make them feel their authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>Not so shall it be among you. On the contrary whoever would become great among you shall be your servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>and whoever among you would be first, shall be slave of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>and justly, for even the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life, a ransom for many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>Then they reached Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>Hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began shouting and saying,  "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.48'>and many kept rebuking him and telling him to be quiet, but he only shouted much louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.49'>Then Jesus stood still, saying, "Call him." So they called the blind man,and said, "Courage, rise, he is calling you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.50'>The man threw off his cloak, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>"What do you want me to do?" said Jesus, addressing him. And the blind man answered, "O Rabboni, that I might receive my sight!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.52'>"Go," said Jesus, "your own faith has saved you," and immediately he received his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.11'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.1'>Now when they were approaching Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.2'>Jesus sent two of his disciples and told them. "Go to that village in front of you, and immediately on entering it you will find a colt tied, upon which no man has ever sat; untie him and bring him here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.3'>And if any man asks you, Why are you doing that?" answer, The Lord has need of him, and he will immediately send him back."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.4'>So they went and found a colt tied outside a door, in the open street, and untied it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.5'>And some of the bystanders began to say to them, "What are you trying to do, untying that colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.6'>So they answered them just as Jesus had told them, and they let them take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.7'>Then they brought the colt to Jesus, and when they had thrown cloaks upon it, Jesus seated himself on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.8'>Then many spread their cloaks on the road, and others, soft leafy branches, which they had cut from the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.9'>and those who went before him and those who came after kept shouting. "Hosanna! Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.10'>Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna, in the highest!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple, and after he had looked around at everything, as the hour was now late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.12'>The next day after leaving Bethany he was hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>and seeing a fig tree in the distance full of leaves, he came to see if he could find anything on it, and found on it nothing but leaves (for it was not the time of figs).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.14'>So, addressing the tree, he said, "Let no man ever more eat fruit from you." And the disciples heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>Presently they reached Jerusalem, and, after entering the Temple courts, Jesus began to drive out those who were buying and selling there, and to upset the tables of the money-changers, and the stalls of those who sold doves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.16'>and he would not allow any one to carry a vessel through the Temple courts, Then he began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.17'>"Is it not written," he said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>The chief priests and the Scribes heard this, and they began to seek means of destroying him; for they were afraid of him because all the crowd were greatly struck with his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.19'>Now every evening he used to go outside the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.20'>and as they (he and his disciples) were passing along in the morning, they saw the fig tree already withered from the root.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>Then Peter remembered, and exclaimed, "Look, Rabbi, the fig tree which you cursed is withered up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>"Take hold on Gods faithfulness," said Jesus to them in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.23'>"In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say to this mountain, Up and hurl yourself into the sea! and shall not doubt in his heart, but on the contrary shall believe that what he says will happen, it will be granted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.24'>That is why I am telling you that whatever you ask for in prayer,  believe that you have received it, and it shall be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.25'>And whenever you stand up to pray, forgive, if you have anything against any one, that so your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>Then they began arguing with one another. "If we say, From heaven,  he will ask, Why then did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>On the other hand, if we say, From men!"They were afraid,  however, of the people, for every one held that Johnhad been really a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.33'>So their answer to Jesus was, "We do not know." "Neither will I tell you," said Jesus, "by what authority I do these things."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Presently Jesus began to speak to them in parables. "There was once a man," he said, "who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the wine-press, built a tower, rented it to tenants, and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>At vintage-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers to collect some of the proceeds of the vineyard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>but they seized him, and flogged him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>Then he sent another slave to them; and this man they knocked over the head and handled shamefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And he sent another; and him they killed; and many others; beating some, and killing some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>He had still one, a Son beloved, He sent him last to them, saying,  "They will reverence my Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>"But those tenants said to themselves. Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>"So they took him and killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What will the owner of the Vineyard do?" "He will come and put the tenants to death," they said, "and will give the vineyard to others."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>"Have you not read this Scripture?" (he continued) "The very stone which the builders rejected Has now become the corner-stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>This is the Lords doing; It is marvelous in our eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they kept seeking to lay hold on him, but were afraid of the crowd, for they knew well that he had spoken this parable about them;  so they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>But they sent some of the Pharisees to Jesus afterward, and some of the Herodians to entrap him in conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>So when they came, they said. "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and are not afraid of any one, for you do not regard the face of men;  nay, but you reach the way of God in truth. Is it right to pay poll-  tax to Caesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Shall we pay, or not pay?" But he, knowing well their hypocrisy,  said to them. "Why are you testing me? Bring me a dollar for me to look at."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>And they brought it. "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"  "Caesars," they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And Jesus said, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God, the things that are Gods." They were amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then came up some Sadducees, men who say there is no resurrection.  They too questioned him, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>"Teacher, Moses taught us that if a mans brother die, and leave a wife behind him, but no child, that his brother is to marry the widow and to raise up a family for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife,  and died leaving no family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>The second married her, and died without offspring; the third likewise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>and the seven had her, and died without issue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>And last of all the woman too died. In the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>"Is not this the reason for your error," Jesus answered them, "that you know not the Scripture nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>When they rise from the dead men do not marry, and women are not given in marriage, but they are as the angels are in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But in regard to the rising again of the dead, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are in grave error."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>Just then up came one of the Scribes who had heard them arguing, and realized that Jesus had answered them admirably. "What commandment,"  he asked, "is the first of all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus replied. "The first is. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>"The second is this, "Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. Other command greater than these there is none."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>"Admirably said, O Teacher," exclaimed the Scribe. "You have truthfully said that He is one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and that beside him there is none other, and to love him with all ones heart and with all ones understanding and with all ones might, and to love ones neighbor as oneself is far beyond all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Jesus saw that he had answered with discrimination, and said to him,  "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that no one ventured to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>While he was teaching in the Temple courts, Jesus in his turn asked.  "How is it that the Scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself said in the Holy Spirit, "The Lord said to my Lord,  Sit at my right hand until I make thy foes the footstool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>"David himself then calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?" Now the great mass of the people were wont to listen to him with delight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>and in his teaching he said. "Look out for the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes, and to receive salutations in the street,  and to have prominent places in the synagogues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and seats of honor at dinner-parties;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>they who consume the property of widows and make long, pretentious prayers. The greater shall their condemnation be."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>Then Jesus took his seat opposite the treasury and watched the people putting their offerings into the chest. Many rich people were putting in large sums.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>There came also a poor widow who dropped in two little coins, worth a cent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>On this he called his disciples to him, and said. "I tell you solemnly that this poor widow has put in more than all who have put their offerings into the treasury;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>for they have all put in what they could spare out of their surplus,  but she, out of her penury, has put in all that she possessed, her whole living."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>As Jesus was walking out of the Temple courts, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and buildings these are!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>"You see these mighty buildings? There shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down," he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter and Jamesand Johnand Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>"Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign that all these predictions are about to be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>So Jesus began to tell them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>"Be ye watchful lest any one mislead you. Many will come in my name,  saying, I am he, and will mislead many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be dismayed,  such things must come, but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>For nation shall rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines;  these are the beginning of birth-pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>"You yourselves must be on your guard. They will hand you over to the courts, and you will be flogged on the synagogues; and you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, to witness to them for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>When, however, they are leading you all to trial, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but whatever is given you in that hour, that say, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>"And brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child,  and children will rise up against their parents, and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>You will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he that endures to the end shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>"But when you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not (let the reader ponder this), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.17'>And alas for the pregnant women, and for those that are nursing their infants in those days!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.18'>Pray that it may not come in the winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.19'>For those will be days of suffering the like of which has never been from the beginning of Gods creation until now, and never shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.20'>And had not the Lord cut short those days, not a single person would escape; but for the elects sake whom he has chosen, he has cut them short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.21'>"At that time if any one tell you, See, here is Christ, or See,  there he is, do not believe it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.22'>for false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders, to lead astray the very chosen, if they can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.23'>Be on your guard! I have told you it all beforehand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.24'>"But when the tribulation is past, in those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.25'>and the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.26'>Then will they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.27'>Then he will send forth the angels and gather his chosen from the four winds, from uttermost earth to uttermost sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.28'>"From the fig tree learn now her parable; as soon as ever her branches are full of sap and bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.29'>So also do you, whenever you see these things happening, know that He is near, at your very door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.30'>I tell you truly that the present generation shall not pass until all these things begin to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.31'>Earth and sky shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.32'>But concerning that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.34'>Take heed! Awake! for you never know the time. As a man gone abroad and leaving his house gives authority to his slaves, to each his task;</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.14'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>Now two days later was the feast of the Passover and of Unleavened Bread. Both the chief priests and the Scribes were continually seeking how they might arrest him by a stratagem and kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>but, "Not on a feast-day," they said, "for fear there should be a riot among the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>And while he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper, while he was dining, a woman came with an alabaster vase of very costly,  pure spikenard perfume, and, breaking the vase, she poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>Some of those who were present said among themselves indignantly.  "Why has the perfume been wasted like this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>That perfume could have been sold for more than one hundred and fifty dollars, and given to the poor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>So they began upbraiding her, but Jesus said. "Let her alone. Why are you troubling her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>She has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor among you, and can show them kindness whenever you wish, but me you will not always have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She has done what she could. she has before time anointed my body for my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>I tell you in solemn truth that wherever the gospel is preached throughout the whole world, there what she has done shall be told in remembrance of her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Now Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went away to the high priests to betray Jesus to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>and they were glad when they heard it, and promised to pay him money. So he kept looking for an opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>And the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, the day for killing the paschal lamb, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparation for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>Then he sent two of his disciples, and told them. "Go into the city,  and you will meet a man carrying a jar of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>Follow him; and whatever house he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks, "Where is your guest-chamber, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.15'>He will himself show you a large, upper room, furnished and ready.  there make preparation for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.16'>So the disciples went off, and came into the city, and found everything as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.17'>So they made ready the Passover, and as night fell he came, with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.18'>While they were at the table, eating, Jesus said solemnly. "It is one of you who will betray me - one who is eating with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.19'>They began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one after another,  "Surely, not I?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.20'>"It is one of the Twelve," said Jesus, "one who is dipping into the same dish with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>For the Son of man is going his way, as the Scripture says, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for that man if he had never been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>And as they were eating he took bread, and after the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "Take it, this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.24'>and he said. "This is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.25'>Solemnly I tell you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,  until that day I drink it new in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.26'>Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.27'>And Jesus said to them. "All of you are about to stumble, for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.28'>"But after my resurrection I will go before you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.29'>"Although they all stumble and fall, yet will not I," answered Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.30'>Jesus said to him, "I tell you in solemn truth that you yourself,  today on this very night, before the cock crow twice, shall three times disown me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>But Peter kept protesting passionately, "Though I must die with you,  I will not disown you!" And they all kept saying the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>So they came to a place named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit down here while I pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>Then he took Peter and Jamesand Johnwith him, and began to be full of terror and distress;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>and he said to them. "My soul is full of anguish, even unto death;  wait here, and keep watch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>So he went a little farther, and throwing himself upon the ground,  he prayed repeatedly that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>"Abba, Father," he said, "all things are possible with thee. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>Then he came and found them asleep, and he said to Peter. "Are you sleeping, Simon? Could you not keep watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>Keep watch, all of you, and pray that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>Then he went away again and prayed, saying the same words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>and when he returned he found them once more asleep, for their eyes were heavy with sleep, and they knew not what to say to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>Then he came the third time, and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest! It is over. My hour is come. Look! the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>Rouse yourselves, let us go. See! my betrayer is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>At that instant, while he was yet speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came up, and with him a mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the high priests and Scribes and elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>Now the betrayer had given them a sign. "The one I kiss," he said,  "is the man. Arrest him, and take him away safely."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>So he came and going straight up to Jesus he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>"Rabbi," and kissed him. Then they laid hands on him and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>But one of the bystanders drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>But Jesus interposed, saying. "Are you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>Day after day I was face to face with you in the Temple courts,  teaching, and you did not seize me. But this is done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>Then they all forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>One young man, however, began following him, with only a linen sheet thrown round his naked body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>They seized him, but he left the linen sheet and fled away naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>Then they took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and Scribes came with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>Peter also had followed Jesus at a distance, until he was inside the court of the high priest. There he was sitting among the officers,  warming himself in the light of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Meanwhile the high priests and all of the Sanhedrin were trying to get evidence against Jesus, so as to have him put to death, but they found none;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>for though many gave false witness against him, their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>Some came forward and swore falsely, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>"We heard him say, I will tear down this temple made by hands, and in three days I will build another temple not made by hands."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But even their evidence did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>Then the high priest rose and stood forth among them. "Have you no answer to make?" he asked Jesus; "What is it that these testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned him. "Are you the Christ," he said, "the Son of the Blessed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>"I am," Jesus answered, "and you all shall see the Son of man seated on the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest tore his vestments. "Why do we need any further witness?" he exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>"Did you hear his blasphemy? What is your verdict?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Then they all condemn him to be worthy of death. Some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him while striking him and saying,  "Prophesy." The officers, too, received him into custody with blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, there came one of the maid servants of the high priest, and saw Peter warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>She looked at him, and said, "You too were with the Nazarene, Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it. He said. "I dont know, I dont understand what you are saying." Then he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>Again the maid servant saw him, and began again to tell the bystanders, "He is one of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>A second time he continued to deny it. After a little the by-  standers began to say to Peter again, "Surely you are one of them,  for you are a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began with curses an solemn oaths to say, "I do not know the man you are talking about."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>At that instant for the second time a cock crew. Then Peter recalled the word which Jesus had spoken to him, "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me thrice." And as he thought of it, he began to weep aloud.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>As soon as it was down, after the high priests had conferred with the elders and the whole Sanhedrin, they bound Jesus, and took him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate questioned him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" In reply Jesus said, "It is as you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>When the chief priests continued making many accusations against him, Pilate repeatedly questioned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>"Do you make no answer?" he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>"See, how many accusations they are making." But Jesus no longer made any answer, at which Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the time of the feast it was customary to release to them a prisoner, whatever one they asked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>A man named Barabbas was there in prison, with some rioters who had committed murder during an uprising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>So when the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to follow his usual custom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>he asked them, "Do you wish me to release the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he recognized that it was through spite that the high priests had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests incited the crowds to have Barabbas released to them, instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>So Pilate spoke to them once more, "What them shall I do to him you call King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>Then they shouted again, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>"Why, what wrong has he done?" Pilate kept saying. But they shouted furiously, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, who wished to make himself strong with the crowd,  released Barabbas to them, and gave Jesus over for crucifixion, after he had scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>The soldiers then led him away into the courtyard (Praetorium), and called together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>They clothed Jesus in purple, and plaited a crown of thorns, and placed it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>Then they began to salute him. "Hail, King of the Jews," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>They kept striking him on the head with a rod, and spitting upon him; and on bended knee they did him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And after their sport with him, they stripped off the purple robe,  and put on his own clothes, and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>Simon a Cyrenian, a passer-by, who was coming from the country (the father of Alexander and Rufus), they commandeered to carry the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>So they led him to the place called Golgotha - a name which means "the place of a skull."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>There they attempted to give him wine mingled with myrrh; but he refused it. Then they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots upon them to see what each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>It was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>Over his head there was written the words of the charge against him.  "The King of the Jews"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>Now with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And the passers-by kept jeering at him, wagging their heads and saying. "Ah! you who were to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, save yourself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>Come down from the cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In the same way the high priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on mocking him to themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>The Christ! The King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe." They also who had been crucified with Jesus kept reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>At noon a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>At three oclock Jesus cried in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>When they heard this, some of the bystanders said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>Then a man ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, and put it on a stick, and offered it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>Then the army captain, who was standing facing Jesus when he thus died, said, "in truth this man was a Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were some women also watching from a distance. Among them were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Jamesthe younger and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>women who used to follow him when he was in Galilee, and minister to him; and many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>Toward sunset, as it was the preparation (that is the day preceding the Sabbath),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>there came Joseph of Arimathea, a Councilor, honorable in rank, who was himself also looking for the kingdom of God. He boldly went in to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>But Pilate wondered whether he were already dead. So he summoned the army captain, and inquired if he had been any time dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>and when he learned the fact from the army captain he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>So Joseph bought him a sheet, and took Jesus down, wound him in the sheet, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock, and then rolled a stone against the opening of the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>and Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching to see where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James, and Salome brought spices in order to go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb as the sun was rising;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>and they kept saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>But then as they looked up they saw that the stone, which was a very large one, was already rolled away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>and upon entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>They were terrified, but he said to them. "Do not be terrified! You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified? He is risen; he is not here. See, the place where they laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, "He is going before you into Galilee, where you will see him, as he told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>So they went out, and ran from the tomb, for they were trembling and amazed; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now after his resurrection, early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>But they, although they heard that he was living and had been seen by her did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking on their way into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>They too went, and told the others; but they did not believe them,  either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward he appeared to the Eleven themselves, as they were eating,  and reproached them for their lack of faith, and stubborn hearts,  because they disbelieved those who had seen him risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them. "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>Moreover these signs shall follow those who believe. They shall drive out demons in my name; they shall speak with new tongues in foreign languages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they shall pick up serpents, and if they drink any poison it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>But they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the miracles which followed.</verse>
