  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ,  and Sosthenes, his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the Church of God at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all, wherever they are, who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I am always thanking God on your behalf, for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you have been enriched in him, in all speech, and in all knowledge</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>(for thus my witness for Christ was confirmed among you);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you lack no divine gift, while you are waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>He will also keep you perfectly stedfast unto the end, so that you will be unreprovable in the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beg you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to speak in accord, all of you, and to have no divisions among you, but to be knit together in a common mind and temper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been plainly told me concerning you, my brothers, by Chloes people, that there are dissensions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>I mean by this that one of you says, "I am a follower of Paul";  another, "I of Apollos"; another, "I of Cephas"; another, "I of Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Paul, was he crucified for you? or was it into the name of Paul that you were baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I am thankful to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>Yes, I did baptize the house of Stephanas also, but I do not think I baptized any one else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not think I baptized any one else. For Christ did not send me forth to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel; and that not in philosophic words, lest the Cross of Christ should be made an empty thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message of the Cross is indeed for those on their way to destruction, foolishness; but for us who are on our way to salvation it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For thus it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the philosophers, And the prudence of the prudent will I confound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Sage, rabbi, skeptic of this present age - where are they all? Has not God made foolish the philosophy of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For when, in the wisdom of God, the world by its philosophy knew not God, the world by its philosophy knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of preaching, to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Jews continue to ask for miracles and Greeks are ever wanting philosophy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we come preaching a crucified Messiah - to Jews a stumbling-  block, to Greeks foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are the called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For consider your own calling, brothers, that not many wise in earthly wisdom, not many powerful, not many of noble birth, have been called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>No, God has chosen the worlds folly to confound its philosophy; and the worlds weakness to confound its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>The worlds base things has God chosen, and the things that are not,  to bring to naught the things that are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no mortal man should glory in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>It is of him that you are in Christ Jesus, whom God made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that as Scripture says, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And when I came to you, brothers, I came not to proclaim Gods great secret purpose in fine language of philosophy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>for I determined to know nothing, while among you, but Jesus as Christ, and him a crucified Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>In weakness and fear and great trembling came I among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My message and my preaching were not in the persuasive language of philosophy, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>in order that your faith should rest, not on human philosophy, but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Notwithstanding, among those who are mature I do teach philosophy;  though not the philosophy of the present age, nor of its rulers who are coming to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>No, it is Gods wisdom that I utter, that hidden wisdom which God had decreed before the world began, unto our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of the present age understands it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>Nay, as it is written. Eye has not seen, Nor ear heard, Neither have entered into mans heart The things which God has prepared For those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>Yet God has unveiled them to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit fathoms everything, even the abysmal depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knows the depths of man except the mans own inner Spirit? Even so, also, the Spirit of God knows the deeps profound of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes forth from God, that we may realize the blessings freely given us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Of these high themes we speak in words not taught by human philosophy, but by the Spirit; interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>The unspiritual man rejects the teachings of Gods Spirit; for him it is folly. He cannot understand it, for it is spiritually discerned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man discerns everything, yet is himself discerned by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For what man understands the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct Him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>As for me, brothers, I could not talk to you as spiritual men, but as to creatures of flesh, mere babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you milk, not meat; for you were unable to bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>You are not able even now, for you are still unspiritual. While there is among you jealousy and strife, are you not still unspiritual, and behaving like worldlings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>When one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere worldlings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Just ministers through whom you have believed, and each doing the work that the Lord gave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So neither is he who planted anything, nor he who watered, but God alone, who is making the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now, though he who plants and he who waters are one, each will receive his own reward, according to his own service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are Gods fellow workers; and you are Gods field, you are Gods building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God vouchsafed me, like a skillful master-  builder, I have laid a foundation; but another will be building upon it. Let each take heed how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>The foundation is already laid - Jesus Christ - and no man can lay another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>On that foundation, if a man proceeds to build gold, silver,  precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, each mans work will be made manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>The Day will disclose it, for it dawns in fire, and the fire will test each mans work, of what quality it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any mans work - the building he has made - stands the test, he will be rewarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any mans work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, as it were through the flames.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know what you are Gods sanctuary, and that the Spirit of God is dwelling within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one tear down Gods sanctuary, God will tear him down; for the sanctuary of God is holy, and that is what you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you supposes that he is wise in the philosophy of the present age, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the philosophy of this world is foolishness in Gods sight. It is written, He snares the wise in their own craftiness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, how futile they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So let no one make boast in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, things present or things to come; all things are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let any man look upon us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the secret truths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Now it is required of stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it matters very little that I am judged by you, or by any earthly court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>Indeed I do not even judge myself; for though I know nothing against myself, yet that does not vindicate me; for he who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So make no hasty judgment until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make plain the purpose of mens hearts. Then each mans due praise will come to him from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brothers, I have applied in a figure to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that in us you might learn not to go beyond what is written; that none of you be puffed up for the one,  against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you a differ, brother? Or what have you that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why are you boasting as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>But you, forsooth, are already full, are you? You are already rich?  Without us you are already reigning? Yes, and I would that you did reign, so that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>But it seems to me that God has exhibited us apostles, last of all,  like men doomed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the whole world, both to men and to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>For Christs sake we are fools, but you are quite philosophic in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are outcast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even to his very hour we are enduring hunger and thirst and nakedness and blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>Homeless men, we toil, working with our own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when defamed, we conciliate. We have been made, as it were, scum-o-the-earth, the very refuse of the world, to this very hour!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I am not writing this to shame you, but to admonish you, as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ Jesus, you can have but one father. For in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I beg you then to imitate my example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>With this in mind I have sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ;  the manner in which I ever teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord, and then I shall learn not the talk of these boasters, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>Which do you want? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and tender spirit?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and such immorality as is not even among the heathen - that a man has taken his fathers wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>Yet you are puffed up instead of mourning and removing from among you the man who has done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I, although absent in body, yet present in spirit, have already passed sentence, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, on him who has done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>When you are gathered together, and my spirit is with you together with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>I have handed over such a man to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that even a little leaven leavens all the lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Then get rid of the old leaven, so that you may be like a new lump,  as you are now unleavened. For our Paschal Lamb has already been sacrificed, Christ himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So let us keep the unending feast, not with any old leaven, neither with leaven of malice and vice, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I told you in my letter not to associate with the immoral.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Not that in this world you were actually to have no contact with the immoral, the avaricious, the thievish, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world, altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But what I wrote was that you were not to associate with any so-  called brother who is immoral, or avaricious, or idolatrous, or abusive, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. No, with such persons do not even sit at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>What have I to do with the judging of outsiders? Must not you judge those who are within the church, while God judges outsiders?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>Expel that wicked man from among you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any one of you who has a grievance against his neighbor go to law before heathen judges, instead of before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try such trifling cases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we are to try angels? How much more, then, the affairs of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>Why then, if you have cases relating to earthly affairs which need to be decided, is it men who are absolutely nothing in the church whom you make your judges?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to shame you. Is it so that there is not among you a single wise man, capable of deciding between a man and his brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>Must brother go to law with brother, and that, too, before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Indeed, to say nothing more, the fact that you have lawsuits with one another is altogether a defect in you. Why not rather suffer injustice? Why not rather endure being cheated?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>On the contrary, you yourselves are inflicting injustice and fraud,  and that upon your brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived. None who are immoral, or idolaters, or adulterers, or catamites, or sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>or thieves, or avaricious men, or drunkards, or foul-mouthed men, or extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>Such were some of you, but you have washed away your stains, you have been consecrated, you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>"All things are lawful for me"? Yes, but not all things are good for me. "All things are lawful for me"? Yes, but I will not let myself be enslaved by the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>"Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food"? Yes, but God will soon put an end both to the one and to the other. The body,  however, exists not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and the God who raised up our Lord will up-raise us also by his mighty power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>You know, do you not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot?  God forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Do you not know that he who joins himself to a harlot is one with her in body? (For God says, The two shall become one flesh.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>While a man who is united with the Lord is one with Him in spirit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee from immorality. Every other sin that a man commits lies outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is within you, the Spirit whom you have from God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>You are not your own; for you have been bought with a price,  therefore glorify God in your bodies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the question in your letter. It is well for a man to have no intercourse with a woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>but because there is so much immorality let each man have his own wife; and let each women have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband give his wife her due, and likewise the wife her husband. The wife is not mistress of her own person,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>but her husband is; and in the same way the husband is not master of his own person, but his wife is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not refuse one another, unless it is only temporary and by mutual consent, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, lest through your lack of self-control Satan begin to tempt you to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But what I have just said is by way of concession, not command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I would that every one lived as I do; but each man has his own special gift from God, one this, another that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But to the unmarried, and the widows, I say that it is well for them to remain as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>If, however, they are not exercising self-control, by all means let them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>But to those already married my commandment is - and not mine, but the Lords - that a wife is not to leave her husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>(or if she has already left him let her either remain as she is, or be reconciled to him), and also that a husband is not to put away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>To the rest it is I who am speaking, not the Lord. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer, if he is willing to live with her,  let him not send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And a woman whose husband is not a believer, if he is willing to live with her, let her not separate from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through union with his believing wife; and the unbelieving wife, through union with her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unholy, but now they are consecrated to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbelieving partner be determined to leave, separation let it be. In such cases the believing husband or wife is not under bondage. But it is into peace that God has called us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Only whatever be the lot in life to which God has assigned each one -  and whatever the condition in which he was living when God called him-  -in that let him continue. Such is the rule I give in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>So, was any man called, being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was any man called when he was uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping Gods commands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Whatever be the condition of life in which he was called, in that let him continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called in slavery? Let not that trouble you; but if you can become free make use of the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lords freedman; and in the same way, the free man who is called is Christs slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You have been brought with a price; do not become slaves to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Where each man stood when he was called, there, brothers, let him stay, close to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>I have no command from the Lord to give you concerning unmarried women; but I give you my opinion, and it is that of a man who,  through the Lords mercy, is deserving of your confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I think then, that in view of the time of suffering now imminent, it is best for a man to remain as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from the marriage bond? Do not seek for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>Yet if you do not marry, you have not done wrong; and if a girl marries, she has not done wrong. Such people, however, will have trouble in worldy affairs, and I wish to spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>Indeed, brothers, the time that remains to us has been shortened; so let those who have wives live as if they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>let those who weep be as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who use the world as though using it sparingly. For the present phase of the world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>So I want you to be free from all anxieties. An unmarried man is anxious about the Lords business, how he may please the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>but a married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how he may please his wife, and he is divided in his mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>Again, the woman who is widow, or the maid, is anxious about the Lords business, how she may be pure in body and in mind; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>It is in your own interest that I say this; not that I may entangle you in a snare, but that I may help you to serve the Lord with fitting and undistracted service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>If, however, a father feels that he is not treating his virgin daughter in a seemly manner, in leaving her unmarried beyond the flower of her age, and so the matter is urgent, let him do what she desires; he commits no sin. Let the marriage take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>On the other hand, he who is firm in his purpose and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has determined to keep his daughter unmarried, does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So he that gives his daughter in marriage is doing right, and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing right, and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound to her husband during his lifetime; but if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she will, provided it be in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is; and I think that I, too, have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have no love, I am become a clanging brass, or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and have all faith, so that I could remove mountains,  but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And though I sell all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it avails me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love suffers long and is kind; love envies not; love makes no parade, is not puffed up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>is not rude, nor selfish, nor easily provoked. Love bears no malice,  never rejoices over wrong-doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>but rejoices when the truth rejoices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>It knows how to be silent, it is trustful, hopeful, patient, enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails; but though there are prophecies, they will fail;  though there are tongues, they will cease; though there is knowledge,  it will be superseded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For our knowing is imperfect, and our prophesying is imperfect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but when the perfect is come, then the perfect will be done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child I spoke like a child, felt like a child, thought like a child; now that I am become a man, I have done with childish things.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Hotly pursue this love, yet seek earnestly spiritual gifts, and chiefly that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks in a "tongue" speaks not to man but to God, for no one understands him, but in the Spirit he utters secret truths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies addresses words to men that build up,  encourage, and console.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in a tongue upbuilds himself; but he who prophesies upbuilds the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I should like you all to speak with "tongues"; but I should rather that you prophesied, For he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now brothers, if I should come to you speaking with tongues, what should I benefit you, unless I speak to you some revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>For if lifeless instruments such as the flute or the harp give no distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is fluted or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>Or, for example, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, what soldier will be prepared for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>In the same way with you, if you utter unintelligible words with your tongue, how can what you say be understood? You will be speaking to the winds!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, let us say, so many languages in the world, and none without its meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I do not know the force of expression, I shall seem a barbarian to the one who uses it, and he will seem a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So also in your case, since you are ambitious for spiritual gifts,  seek to excel in them for the upbuilding of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>So let him who speaks with tongues pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What then? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray also with my mind. I will praise God with my spirit, but I will praise him with my mind, also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>For if you in your spirit bless God, how shall he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen to your thanksgiving, when he does not know what you are talking about?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>You on the one hand offer a good thanksgiving, but the other is not built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>Thank God I speak with tongues more than you all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, so as to instruct others, than ten thousand in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not become children in understanding; be babes in malice, but in understanding become mature men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the Law it is written. With men of other tongues, and by the lips of strangers, will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then the gift of tongues is for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Accordingly, when the whole church assemblies, and everybody is speaking "with tongues," if there enter men unlearned or unbelieving,  will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all are prophesying when an unlearned or unbelieving man enters, he is convicted in conscience by your speaker, he feels himself judged by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>and the secret depths of his heart are laid open. So he will fall upon his face and worship God, saying, "Of a truth, God is with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What follows, then, brothers? Whenever you meet together, each contributes something; a psalm, a sermon, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. Let all be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any one speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in turn, and let some one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no one to interpret, let them keep silence in the church, and speak to themselves and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others exercise their judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if to one as he sits there some revelation is made, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can all prophesy one by one; so that all may be learning,  and all may be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. This custom prevails in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>"In your congregation" you write, "as in all the churches of the saints, let the women keep silence in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak. On the contrary let them be subordinate, as also says the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a women to speak in church."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>What, was it from you that the word of God went forth, or to you only did it come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I am now writing you is a command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any one disregard it he will be disregarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So, my brothers, be ambitious for the gift of prophecy, and speak not against the gifts of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let everything be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I am calling to your remembrance, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which you also received, and on which you have taken your stand, ;47 The first man is of the earth, earthly; the second Man is of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which also you are saved, if you are holding fast the message which I preached to you; unless indeed you have believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For the very first thing I taught you was that I had myself been taught, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scripture,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and was seen by Cephas, and then by the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Afterward he was seen at one time by more than five hundred brethren, most of whom are still alive, but some are fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he was seen by James, then by all the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>and last of all, as by one born out of due time, he was seen by me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, I who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and that grace of his,  bestowed upon me, did not prove ineffectual. I labored more abundantly than all the rest, yet not I, but by the grace of God that is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>But whether it is I or they, thus do I preach, and thus you came to believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>If then, we are preaching Christ, that he rose from the dead, how are some of you saying that there is no resurrection from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection from the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, and vain also is your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>More than that, we are detected in bearing false witness against God; because we testified of God that he raised Christ from the dead,  whom he did not raise, if indeed the dead rise not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ arisen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>and if Christ be not risen, your faith is vain, you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>More than that, those who are sleeping in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all mankind most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now, now, Christ is risen from the dead, the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by man came to death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own order; Christ the first-fruits, then those who belong to Christ at his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>And then the end, when he shall hand over his kingdom to God his Father, after he has abolished all rule and authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must rule until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that will be destroyed is Death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For He hast put all things under his feet, but in that quotation All things are put under him, it is evident that God is excepted, who put all things under Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>For when everything is subjected to him, then the Son himself shall subject himself to Him who made them subject, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are really not raised, why are they baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Yes, and why am I myself exposed to danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>Every day I am facing death, my brothers, I affirm it by that pride in you which I have through Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If after the manner of men I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what good does it do me? If the dead do not rise, Let us eat and drink, For we shall be dead tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not deceive yourselves. Evil companions ruin good morals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Wake up, do justly, cease from sin; for I say to your shame that some of you have no acquaintance with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will ask. "How are the dead raised? and with what body are they coming?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Foolish man! The seed you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And when you sow the seed you are not sowing the body that it will become, but bare grain, of wheat perhaps, or some other grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it what body he pleases, and to each kind of seed its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh; there is human flesh, another of fishes of animals, another of birds, another of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are both celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; but the splendor of the celestial is one thing, and the splendor of the terrestrial is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So it is in the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption,  It is raised in incorruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>Sown in weakness, It is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>The body sown is animal The body is raised is spiritual. If there is an animal body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus it is written. The first man, Adam, became a living being, the last Adam, a life-giving Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>Now it is not the spiritual which is first, but the animal, and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Like him who was of earth, are the earthy; and like Him who is of heaven, are the heavenly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>As we have borne the likeness of him who was of earth, so also let us bear the likeness of Him who is of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>I tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Lo, I tell you a secret truth. we shall not all be sleeping, but we shall be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet sounds. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised,  incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must be clothed with incorruption, and this mortal must be clothed with immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>And when this mortal has been clothed with immortality, then will the words of Scripture come to pass, Death has been swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>Where, Death, is thy victory? Where, Death, is thy sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So, my brothers beloved, stand firm, immovable, always abounding in work for the Lord, because you know that your toil is not fruitless in the Lord.</verse>
