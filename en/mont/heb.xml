  <div type='book' osisID='Heb'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who in ancient days spoke to our ancestors in the prophets, at many different times and by various methods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has at the end of these days spoken to us in a Son whom he appointed heir of all things; through whom also he made the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>He being an emanation of Gods glory and stamp of his substance, and upholding the universe by the utterances of his power, after by himself making purification of our sins, has taken his seat on the right hand of the Majesty on High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>He is as much superior to the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to what angel did God ever say, Thou art my son; this day have I become thy Father? and again, I will be a father to him, and he shall be to me a son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And further, when he brought the firstborn into the habitable world,  he said, Let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>While of the angels he said, He makes his angels into winds, His ministering servants into flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But to the Son he says. Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever, And the scepter of thy kingdom is the scepter of justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore did God, thy God, anoint thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And, Thou, O Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, And the heavens are the work of thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They will perish, but thou remainest; They all will grow old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>Like a mantle thou wilt fold them up, And like a garment they will be changed. But thou art the same, And thy years will never fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which of the angels has he ever said, Sit at my right hand, Till I make thy foes a footstool for thy feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service in behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>For this reason we must pay the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, for fear we should drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word uttered through angels stood firm, so that every transgression and act of disobedience met with its just retribution,  how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>Which having begun to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God himself corroborating their testimony by signs and wonders and a variety of miraculous powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit imparted in accordance with his own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>It is not to angels that God subjected the age to be, of which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But some one, somewhere, testified, saying. What is Man, that thou art mindful of him? Or any man, that thou carest for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him only a little lower that the angels; With glory and honor hast thou crowned him; And hast set him to govern the works of thy hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>Thou hast put all things under his feet. For this putting all things under man means leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not yet see all things subject to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>What we do see is Jesus, who was made for a time a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor, because of the suffering of death, in order that through Gods grace he might taste death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it befitted him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both he who sanctifies and those whom he is sanctifying are all from One; for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,  saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>I will proclaim thy name to my brothers; In the midst of the Church I will hymn thy praises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, I myself will put my trust in God. And again, Lo, I and the children God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore, since the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also similarly partook of the same, in order that through death he might render powerless him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>And might deliver those who through fear of death had been subject to life-long bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For assuredly it is not angels, nay, it is the offspring of Abraham,  whom he is ever taking by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>And so it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers, so that he might become a compassionate and faithful high priest, in all that relates to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For inasmuch as he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted, he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, comrades of a heavenly calling, fix your thoughts then upon Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>How faithful he was to the God who appointed him! For while Moses also was faithful in all Gods house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built a house has higher honor than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house has its builder; but he who built the universe is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, bearing testimony to a witness about to be spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ as a Son in his own house; and we are that house, if we retain the cheerful courage and pride of our hope firm unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says. If you hear Gods voice today,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>Continue not to harden your hearts as in the Provocation, On the day of temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>When your forefathers tried my forbearance And saw my deeds for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>For this reason I was sore displeased with that generation, And said, "They are always wandering in their hearts; They have never learned my ways";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in my wrath, "They shall never enter into my rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>See to it, brothers, that there shall never be in any one of you an evil and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in apostasy from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>On the contrary, encourage each other daily, so long as there is a "Today," so that no one of you is hindered by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are become comrades of the Christ, if we hold our first title deed firm until the very end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>In the words of Scripture, Today, if you hear his voice, Do not continue to harden your hearts as at the Provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For who were they that heard and yet provoked him? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear that they should never enter into his rest,  if not to those who had proved faithless? So you see that it was through unbelief that they were not able to enter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us be on our guard, then, though there is a promise still standing of being admitted to his rest, lest any one of you should be found to have come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For the Good News is come to us just as it did to them. But the message they heard was of no benefit to them, because they did not share the faith of those who gave heed to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>We are actually entering into that rest, we who have believed, as God has said, -In my wrath I swore - "They shall not enter into my Rest," although his works were finished since the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he has said, somewhere, regarding the seventh day, And God rested on the seventh day from all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And again in this passage, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since, then, it remains that some should enter into it, and since those who formerly had the Good News preached to them did not enter in because of unbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>he again fixes a day, saying long afterward by Davids lips, in words already quoted, Today if you hear his voice, Continue not to harden your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>So there remains a Sabbath Rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For whoever has entered into his rest has rested from his works,  just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us, then, be earnest to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For living is the Word of God, and active, and sharper than any two-  edged sword, piercing even to the severance of soul form spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the very thoughts and conceptions of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is not a creature hidden form him, but all things are naked and laid prostrate before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Inasmuch, then, as we have a great High Priest, Jesus, the Son of God, who has passed through the heavens, let us hold fast our confession of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us, then, draw near with glad boldness to the throne of grace,  that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help us in our times of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest chosen from time to time from among men is appointed on behalf of men, in matters relating to God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is encompassed with moral weakness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and because of this weakness he is bound to offer sin-offerings not only for the people, but also for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>Again no one takes this honorable office for himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So even the Christ was not raised to the high glory of the priesthood by himself, but on the contrary by Him who said to him.  Thou art my Son; this day have I become thy Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>and again, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>In the days of his flesh, with better cries and weeping Jesus offered up prayers and supplications to Him who was able to save him out of death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Though he was a son, yet learned he obedience through the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and by being thus made perfect, he became the source of enduring salvation to all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>while God himself pronounced him High Priest according to the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning him I have much to say, and much that is hard to make clear to you, because you have grown dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>And this too, although you ought by this time to be teaching others,  you are still needing some one to teach you the very rudiments of divine revelation. You need milk, not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For every one who feeds on milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness. He is still an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for adults, that is, for those who by constant practise have their faculties trained to discriminate between good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>So let us get beyond the teaching of the elementary doctrines of Christ, and let us be borne along toward what is mature. Let us not be continually laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of faith in God, of the teaching regarding ablutions and the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For in the case of those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the Future Age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and then fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance. For they repeatedly crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and expose him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For land that has drunk the showers that now and again fall upon it,  and produced vegetation useful for those for whom it was tilled,  receives a blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but if it produces thorns and thistles, it is considered worthless,  and is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But though we thus speak, we are persuaded better things of you,  beloved, and things that accompany salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you showed for his cause, in sending help to your fellow Christians, as you are still doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>but I am longing that each of you continue to show the same diligence to realize the fulness of your hope, even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>Then do not become slack, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God make the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself, saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>Surely I will bless you, and bless you; I will increase you, and increase you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so by patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>I am referring to the oath because men swear by what is greater than themselves, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>On which principle God, wishing to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his purpose, mediated with an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that by means of two immutable things - his promise and his oath - in which it is impossible for God to break faith, we refugees may have strong encouragement to grasp the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, secure and strong, and passing into the sanctuary which is beyond the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>whither Jesus himself is entered as a forerunner on our behalf,  having become a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>It was this Melchisedek, King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>and it was to him that Abraham apportioned a tithe of all the spoil.  He was first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and then King of Salem, that is, King of Peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father or mother, without lineage, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest in perpetuity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But observe how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the Patriarch, gave a tenth part of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>Now those of the sons of Levi who are appointed to the priesthood,  are authorized by the Law to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brothers, and that too, although these are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But this man who had no Levitical genealogy actually took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him to whom the promises belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now it is beyond all controversy that the inferior is always blessed by the superior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Again it is mortal men who receive tithes in the one case; while in the other it is he of whom it is attested, "He lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And even Levi, who is the receiver of tithes, so to speak, paid tithes through Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for Levi was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood, (and it was under it that the people received the Law) why was it still necessary for another kind of priest to arise, after the order of Melchisedek, instead of being reckoned according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when the priesthood changes, of necessity the law also changes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>He who is thus described belonged to another tribe, not one member of which has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing concerning the priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And this is yet more abundantly clear if, after the likeness of Melchisedek, there arises another Priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has become such, not according to the law of a transitory enactment, but according to the energy of an indissoluble life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For the words are in evidence, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For there is a setting aside of a foregoing commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the Law brought nothing to perfection); and there is the bringing in of a better hope by which we draw near to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>mightier because it was not promised apart from an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>For although those priests became such without an oath, He had an oath form God who said to him, The Lord hath sworn and will not change, Thou art a priest forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>And by so much Jesus becomes the guarantor of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they indeed have been made priests, many in number, because they have been prevented by death from continuing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because of his abiding forever, holds his priesthood inviolable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Hence also he is able to continue saving to the uttermost those who are ever drawing near to God through him, seeing that he is ever living to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For we needed just such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled,  separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>one who has no need, like the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people. For his sacrifice was made once for all, when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the Law appoints human beings to be high priests, men with all their weakness; but the word of the oath, which was later than the Law, appoints a Son, perfected forevermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>The pith of all that we have been saying is this; we do have such a High Priest; and he has taken his seat on the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; whence it follows that this High Priest also must have some offering to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>Now were he on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are here those who present the gifts according to the Law -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>those priests who serve a mere outline and shadow of the heavenly reality, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to build the Tabernacle. "See", he says, "that you make everything on the pattern showed you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But Jesus has obtained a better ministry, by so much as he is also Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>But finding fault with them, He says. "There are days coming," says the Lord, "When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>Not according tot he covenant which I made with their forefathers,  On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in my covenant, And therefore I disregarded them," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>"For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel, After these days," says the Lord; "I will put my laws into their minds, And upon their hearts will I write them; And I will be their God, And they shall be my people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will have mercy upon their wrong-doings, And their sins I will remember no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>By calling the covenant "new," He has made the first one obsolete;  and whatever is becoming obsolete and aged, is near to vanishing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first covenant had its ordinances of public worship,  and its sanctuary, a material one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tent was built, the outer one called the Holy Place, in which were the lamp and the table and the loaves of the Presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and behind the second veil was the tent called the Holy of Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>In it was the golden altar of incense, and also the Ark of the Covenant covered all over with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aarons rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>while above it, overshadowing the mercy-seat, were the cherubim of glory. But I must not speak about these in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Such then were the arrangements. Into the outer tent the priests enter continually in the performance of their duties;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the inner tent the high priest only goes alone, once a year, and that not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the ignorances of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit teaching by this that the way into the Holiest has not yet been disclosed while the first tent is still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>This is a parable, for the present time, according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered that are not able, as far as conscience is concerned, to perfect the worshiper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>since they consist only in meats and drinks and various ablutions,  carnal ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But when Christ came, a High Priest of good things to come, he passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands,  that is to say, not of this material creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>not taking the blood of goats and oxen, but his own blood, and entered once for all into the Holy Place, obtaining for us an eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleansing of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through his eternal spirit offered himself free from blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works unto the service of an ever-living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And because of this he is the Mediator of a new testament, in order that, since a death has taken place to atone for offenses committed under the first testament, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a testament, there must also be brought forward in evidence the death of the testator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament is only of force in case of the dead, being never valid so long as the testator lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Accordingly we find that not without blood was the first testament enacted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For after every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, This is the blood of that testament which God commanded in regard to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of service he sprinkled likewise, and indeed, according to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>almost everything is purified by blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>While, then, it was necessary that the copies of the heavenly things should be cleansed by such sacrifices, the heavenly things themselves required nobler sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For it was not into a Sanctuary made by hands, a mere type of the reality, that Christ entered, but he entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the very presence of God on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor did he enter to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest entered into the sanctuary, year after year, with blood that was not his own; (for in that case he would have needed to suffer repeatedly,  ever since the foundation of the world;)but now, once for all, at the end of the ages, he has appeared to abolish sin, but the offering of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And since it is appointed to men once to die, and after that the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also the Christ, after being once for all offered to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who wait for him for salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the Law, being only a shadow of the good things to come, and not their very substance, its priests cannot with the same sacrifice which year after year they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshippers having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But on the other hand, in these sacrifices sins are called to memory, year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>It is for this reason that the Christ, on coming into the world,  declared. Sacrifice and offerings thou dost not desire, But a body didst thou prepare for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, "I am come - in the roll of the book it is written of me-  -To do thy will, O God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>First when it is said, Thou hast no longing for, thou takest no delight in Sacrifices and offerings, or whole burnt offerings and sin offerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>(offerings regularly made under the law), and then it is added, Lo,  I come to do thy will, he does away with the first, in order that he may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>And it is by this will that we have been sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>For while every priest stands, day after day, at his ministrations,  and many times repeats the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>this Priest, after offering one Sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on Gods right hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>henceforth waiting until his enemies be put as the footstool of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one single offering he has perfected forever those whom he is sanctifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Spirit also gives his testimony, when he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>"This is the covenant I will make with them After those days," says the Lord. "I will set my laws upon their hearts, And I will inscribe them on their minds."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>Then he adds, And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>But when these have been remitted, there is no more any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Since, then, we have a cheerful confidence, brothers, to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the way which he dedicated for us, that new and living way,  through the veil (that is, his flesh);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great High Priest over the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from and evil conscience, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope, unwavering (for He is faithful who promised);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and good works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some, but exhorting one another; all the more as you behold the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any other sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fiery indignation which is about to devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Any one who set at naught the law of Moses was put to death without pity, on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much surer, think you, will be the punishment of one who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has profaned that covenant blood with which he was sanctified, and has done despite to the spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know Him who said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But ever call to mind the former days, in which, after having been enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>partly by being made a public spectacle in reproaches and afflictions, and partly by sharing the fortunes of those that were so used.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you did sympathize with the prisoners, and you did take joyfully the confiscation of your goods; conscious that you had for yourselves greater, even lasting possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Now do not fling away your bold confidence, for it has a great recompense of reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you need stedfastness, so that after having done the will of God, you may receive the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a very, very little while, and then The Coming One will have come, without delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But it is by faith that my Righteous One will live, And if he draws back, my soul takes no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>"But we are not of defections unto perdition, but of faith unto the gaining of the soul."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the title-deed of things hoped for; the putting to the proof of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it men of old times had witness borne to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that the world was fashioned by the Word of God, so that what we see was not made out of what is visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice more acceptable than that of Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God giving the testimony by accepting his gifts; and through it he, although he is dead, still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him. Before his translation he had witness borne to him that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>now without faith it is impossible to please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he ever rewards those who are seeking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, warned of God of things not yet seen, reverently gave heed, and built an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>It was by faith that he sojourned in the promised land as an alien,  living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, his fellow heirs of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he continually looked for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed,  although she was past the age for child-bearing, because she counted Him faithful who had promised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>and thus there sprang from one man, and him practically dead, a nation like the stars in the heavens in multitude, or grains of sand upon the seashore, innumerable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died in faith, not having yet received the promises; nay,  but they saw them from afar, and hailed them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a Fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And if they had cherished the memory of that land from which they went out, they would have found an opportunity to return;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>but now they are longing for a better homeland, that is, a heavenly.  Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; and he has prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was put to the test, was on the point of offering up Isaac; yes, he who had received the promise was about to offer up his only son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>of whom it had been said, It is through Isaac that your posterity will be traced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>For he accounted God able even to raise from the dead, from whence,  figuratively speaking, he did indeed receive him back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Josephs sons,  and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the exodus of the children of Israel, and gave instructions in regard to his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the kings decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>He accounted the obloquy of Christ to be greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he fixed his eyes on the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not because he feared the wrath of the king,  but he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he established the Passover, and the sprinkling with blood,  in order that the Destroying Angel might not touch the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith the people crossed over the Red Sea as on dry land; and when the Egyptians tried to do this they were swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>By faith Rahab, the harlot, perished not with the disobedient,  because she had received the spies in peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, proved valiant in warfare, and routed armies of aliens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Woman received their dear ones alive from the dead; and others were broken on the wheel, not accepting the offered deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>Others again bore trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, even of chains and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, persecuted, tormented -</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>Yet, though these all had witness borne to them by their faith, they received not the promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'>since it was for us that God had in store some better thing, so that apart from us they should not be perfected.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>Seeing then that we are encircled with this great cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and the sin that clings about us. Let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Let us then go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For we have not here an abiding city, but we are earnestly seeking the city that is to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>In his name, then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is the fruit of lips that confess his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>And forget not to be kind and liberal; for with that sort of sacrifice God is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who must give account; that they may do thus with joy and not with lamentation, for this would be unprofitable to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Keep on praying for me. I am persuaded that I have a clear conscience, and I desire in every way to live nobly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, that I may be the more speedily restored to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus,  that great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>equip you in every good deed for the doing of his will, doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory unto the ages of the ages! Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>But I entreat you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>You know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he comes soon, I will see him with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Salute all your leaders and the saints. The brothers from Italy send you greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace be with you all, Amen.</verse>
