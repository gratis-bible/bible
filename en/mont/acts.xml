  <div type='book' osisID='Acts'>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>My first account, O Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus began doing and teaching from the beginning down to the day when,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>after giving instructions through the Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>After his sufferings he had also shown himself alive to them in many convincing manifestations, revealing himself to them during forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And once when he was eating with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father. "Of this,"  he said, "you have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>"For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>So, when they came together, they began to ask him, "Master, are you at this time about to restore the kingdom of Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He answered. "It is not for you to know times and occasions which the Father has fixed in his own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>"yet you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you are to be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the very ends of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>When he had said this, and while they were looking at him, he was lifted up, and a cloud received him up out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>While they were gazing into the sky as he was going up, suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>and they said. "Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into the sky will come back in just the same way as you have seen him going into the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet,  which is near Jerusalem, about a Sabbath Days journey distant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>On entering the city they went to the upper room where they were accustomed to meet. They were Peter and John and James and Andrew,  Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alphaeus,  and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all with one mind gave their constant attention to prayer,  together with some women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>It was during these days that Peter stood up among the brothers - the whole number of persons present was about one hundred and twenty - and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>"Men and brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit uttered beforehand by the lips of David in regard to Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>"For he was numbered among us, and he did get his allotted share of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>"Now this man bought a plot of ground with the price of his treachery, and falling there headlong he burst asunder and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>"This fact became known to the people of Jerusalem so that the place was called in their language, Acheldamach, The Field of Blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>"For it is written in the Book of Psalms, Let his dwelling-place be desolate; Let no man dwell there, also, Let another take his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>"It is necessary then that, of the men who have been associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>from his baptism by John down to the day on which he was taken up from us, one should join us a witness to his resurrection."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>So they placed two in nomination, Joseph called Bar-Sabbas (surnamed Justas) and Matthias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>and they prayed, saying. "Thou, O Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show clearly which of these two men thou hast chosen to fill the place</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>"in this ministry of this apostles from which Judas went out to go to his own place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>When the day of Pentecost was fully come, and they were all together in the same place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>there came suddenly from the sky a sound like the onrush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>There appeared to them tongues, like flame, distributing themselves,  one resting upon the head of each one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit was giving them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were, staying in Jerusalem. devout Jews from many and distant lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>So when this noise was heard, the crowd gathered in bewilderment because each man heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>The were beside themselves with wonder. "Are not these Galileans who are speaking?" they exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>"Then how is it that each one of us hears them speak his own mother tongue?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, in Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>in Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the district of Lybia around Cretans and Arabians,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>we all hear these men telling in our own tongue what great things God has done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>All were astonished and bewildered and kept saying to one another,  "What can this mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others were saying with jeer, "These men are full of sweet wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Then Peter, with the Eleven, stood up and addresses them in a loud voice. "Men of Judea and dwellers in Jerusalem, have no doubt about this matter, but listen to what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>"These men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only nine oclock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>"No, this is what the prophet Joel predicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>"In the last days, God says, it shall come to pass that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind; "Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days, will I pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>In the sky above I will show marvels, And signs in the earth beneath; Blood and fire, and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>Into darkness shall the sun be turned, And into blood the moon, Ere the day of the Lord come, that great and terrible day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>"Men of Israel, listen to these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man accredited to you by God, through mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you, as you yourselves know;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>him, delivered up by the settled purpose and fore-knowledge of God,  you crucified and killed at the hands of lawless men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>but God has raised him to life, having loosed the pangs of death,  because it was not possible for death to hold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says of him. "I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is at my right hand lest I be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>"Therefore my heart is glad, my tongue exults, my very body also shall pitch its tent in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>"For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, Nor give up thy Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>"Thou hast made known to me the paths of life, Thou wilt fill me with gladness in thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>"Men and brothers, I can speak plainly to you concerning the patriarch David, because he not only died and was buried, but his tomb is among us even to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>"Because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins he would set one on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>"he, foreseeing this, spoke of the resurrection of Christ that neither was he left in Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus God has raised up, of this we are all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Since he is by the mighty hand of God exalted, and has received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this which you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into heaven; but he himself said, "The Lord said to my Lord Sit thou on my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>"Until I make thine enemies A footstool under thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>"Therefore let the whole House of Israel know assuredly that Gods has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>When they heard these words they were stung to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles. "Men and brothers, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>"Repent," answered Peter, "and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>"For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all who are afar off, whomever the Lord may call."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>With many other words he continued to bear testimony, and kept entreating them, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then those who welcomed his message were baptized, and in that day about three thousand souls were added to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>and they stedfastly continued in the teaching of the apostles, and in the fellowship, in the breaking of the bread, and in the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all the believers were together, and had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They would sell their lands and other property, and distribute the proceeds among all, just as any one from time had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Day after day they continued stedfastly with one accord in the Temple; and breaking bread together in their own homes, they continued to eat their food with gladness and an undivided heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God, and looked on with favor by all the people. Meanwhile the Lord kept adding to them daily those that were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>One day Peter and John were going up together for the hour of prayer, at three in the afternoon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>when a man lame from his birth was carried along, who was wont to be laid each day near the gate of the Temple called the Beautiful Gate,  to ask alms of those who were going into the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>When he saw Peter and John about to go into the Temple, he kept asking them for alms;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter fixed his eyes upon him, as did John, and said, "Look at us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>So he waited, expecting to get something from them. Then Peter said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>"I have neither silver nor gold, but what I do have, this I am going to give to you; in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, walk!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>Then taking his right hand he lifted him up. Instantly his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>and leaping forth he stood on his feet, and began to walk, and went with them into the Temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and recognized that this was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people crowded awe-  struck around them, in what was known as Solomons Portico.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>When he saw this, Peter said to the people. "Men of Israel, why are you wondering at this? Why do you stare at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>"The God of Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to let him go;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>"but you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked as a favor the release of a murderer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>"The Pioneer of Life you put to death. But God has raised him from the dead, and we are witnesses of that fact.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>"And his name, on the ground of faith in his name, has made strong this man, whom you now see and know; yes, the faith that is through him has made this man sound and strong again, in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>"And now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>"But God has thus fulfilled what he foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>"Repent then! and reform, from the blotting out of your sins, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>"and that he may send Jesus, your appointed Messiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>"whom the heavens must receive until the time of restoration of all things. "God spoke of this ages ago, through the mouth of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>"Moses, for example, said. "The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brothers, as he raised up me; you must listen to whatever he may tell you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>"and it shall be that every soul who will not listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>"Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and his successors, all that have spoken, have also told of those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>"You are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>"It was for you first that God raised up his Servant, and sent him to bless you in turning every one of you away from your wicked ways."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>While they were addressing the people the priests, the commander of the Temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>incensed at their teaching the people, and proclaiming, in the case of Jesus, the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They arrested them, and put them in prison till the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>There was held in Jerusalem, next morning, a meeting of their rulers, the elders and scribes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas, the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all the members of the high priests family were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>Then they made the men stand before them and demanded, "By what power, or in what name, have you fellows done this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>"Rulers and elders of the people, if we are being examined today concerning a benefit conferred upon a cripple, as to how has this man been cured,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>"be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand before you strong and well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>"For he is the Stone, cast aside by you builders, which has become the head stone of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>"There is no salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men, in which we must be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they beheld the glad fearlessness of Peter and John and had perceived that they were amazed; and they began to recognize them, that they were companions of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>But since they saw the man standing with them who had been healed,  they had nothing to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>So they bade them withdraw from the Sanhedrin, while they conferred together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>"What," said they, "shall we do with these men? For it is well known throughout Jerusalem that a notable miracle has been performed by them, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>"But that the matter may spread no further among the people, let us threaten them not to speak to any one hereafter about this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>So they summoned them, and ordered them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John said in reply. "Do you decide whether in the sight of God it is right to obey you rather than God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>but for our part, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So when they had further threatened them they let the apostles go,  being quite unable to find any way of punishing them because of the people, for everybody was glorifying God over what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought was over forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>As soon as the apostles were released, they went to their friends,  and told what the high priests and elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And when they heard it they all lifted up their voices in prayer to God, saying. "O Sovereign Lord, who madest heaven and earth and sea,  and all that in them is,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>"who saidest through the Holy Spirit, by the lips of thy servant David, our forefather. "Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples form futile plans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>"The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together Against the Lord and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>"In this very city they did gather together against thy holy Servant, Jesus whom thou hast anointed - Herod and Pontius Pilate,  with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>"to do all that thy power and thy will had predetermined should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>"And now Lord, listen to their threats, and grant to thy slaves to proclaim thy message with all boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>"whilst thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; grant too, that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant,  Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken;  and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak the message of the Lord with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>Now the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one soul,  nor did any one of them say that any of his possessions was his own;  but they had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And the apostles continued with great power to give their witness concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>Nor was there any one of them in want, for all who owned houses or lands would sell them and bring the price of the things that were sold, and lay it at the apostles feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and distribution would be made to each according to his need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>In this way Joseph, whom the apostles called Barnabas ("Son of Encouragement" is what it means), who was a native Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>sold a farm which he had, and brought the price, and laid it at the apostles feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a man named Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira, sold a farm of his,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>kept back some of the purchase price, with the connivance of his wife. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>"Ananias," said Peter, "why has Satan so filled your heart that you are lying to the Holy Spirit, and keeping back part of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>"While it remained unsold, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was not the price at your own disposal? How could you conceive this act in your heart? You have not lied unto men, but unto God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>As Ananias heard these words he fell down and expired, and all who heard were awe-struck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>But the younger men rose, wrapped the body up, and carried it out to bury it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>and Peter said to her, "Tell me if you got so much for the land."  "Yes," she said, "so much."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>"Why was it," said Peter, "that you both agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Lo, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>Instantly she fell down at his feet and expired, and when the young men came in they found her dead, and carried her out and buried her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear fell on all the church and upon all who had heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>Many signs and wonders continued to be wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles, and by common consent they all would meet in Solomons Porch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>but none of the rest dared to associate with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>Yet the people continued to hold them in high honor, and more and more believers in the Lord were joining them, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>In consequence people would even bring out their sick into the streets, and place them upon beds and pallets as Peter was passing,  that at least his shadow might fall upon some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>The people of the towns near Jerusalem also continued to come in crowds, bringing their sick and those who were harried by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>This aroused bitter indignation among the high priest and his followers who were of the sect of the Sadducees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and they apprehended the apostles, and threw them into the public prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors during the night,  and let them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>He said to them, "Go take your stand in the Temple, and continue to tell the people all the words of this Life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>When they heard this they went at early dawn to the Temple, and began to teach. Meantime when the high priest and his followers arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin and all the Council of the Elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to fetch the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But the officers who went did not find them in the prison; so they came back and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>"The prison we found locked fast, with the guards stationed at the doors, but when they were opened we found no one inside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>When the officer in charge of the Temple and the high priest heard these words, they were perplexed concerning them, wondering what would come of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>And some one came and told them that the very men whom they had put in prison were standing in the Temple, and teaching to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>On this the officer went off with his men and fetched them, not,  however, by force, for they were afraid that the people would stone them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>So they brought them, and stood them before the Sanhedrin. Then the high priest questioned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>"We strictly forbade you, did we not, to teach about this Name, and here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the apostles said in reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>"We must obey God rather than man. The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew by hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>"Him God has exalted at his right hand as Prince and Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>"And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>When they heard this they were infuriated, and were minded to kill the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>but Gamaliel, a Pharisee, a teacher of the law, and held in honor by all the people, rose from his seat, and ordered the apostles to be put outside for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>He said. "Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>"Years ago Theudas arose, claiming to be somebody, and was joined by about four hundred men. He was killed, and all of his followers dispersed and annihilated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>"After him Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment,  and drew away some of the people after him. He also perished, and all his followers were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>"And now, I say to you, hold aloof from these men. Let them alone;  for if this scheme or work be of human origin it will come to nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>"but if it is from God, you cannot put it down; you may even find yourselves fighting against God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>They gave in to him; and called the apostles in, and after flogging them, released them, with instructions not to speak about the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>So they left Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of the Name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>but not for a single day did they desist from teaching and preaching in the Temple, and in private houses, the Gospel of Jesus, the Messiah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>Now in these days while the number of the disciples was multiplying,  the Grecian Jews began to murmur against the Hebrews, because their widows were habitually overlooked in the distribution of alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>Then the Twelve called the general body of the disciples together,  and said to them. "It is not fitting for us to leave off preaching the Word of God, and minister at tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>"So, brothers, find from among your own number seven men of good reputation who are full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them over this business.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>This plan commended itself to the whole body, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip,  Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>These men they presented to the apostles who, when they had prayed,  laid their hands upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of the Lord continued to spread; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was increasing exceedingly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>Meanwhile Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But certain men from the so-called "Synagogue of the Freedmen" and certain Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, Cilicians, and men from Roman Asia, started to dispute with Stephen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>but were unable to withstand the wisdom and spirit with which he used to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they instigated some to say, "We have heard him speaking blasphemy against Moses and against God;" and in this way they excited the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>The elders and the scribes rushed upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>They also set up false witnesses who testified. "This fellow is continually talking against the Holy Place and against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>"For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which were handed down to us by Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>Then all who were sitting in the council at once fixed their eyes upon him, and saw his face like the face of an angel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>And the high priest said, "Are these things so?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>Stephen answered. "Listen, brothers and fathers. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>"So he left Chaldea and settled in Haran, and from there, after his fathers death, God moved him to this land which you inhabit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>"But he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not a single square yard of ground; yet he promised to bestow the land as a permanent possession on him and his posterity - he at that time being childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>"What God said was this. "His offspring will sojourn in a foreign land where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>"And the nation, whichever it is, that enslaves them I will judge,  said God, and after ward they shall come out, and they shall worship me in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>"Then he gave him a covenant of circumcision, and under this covenant he became the father of Isaac, whom he circumcised on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>"The patriarchs out of jealousy sold Joseph into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>"But God was with him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions,  and gave him grace and wisdom, when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor over Egypt, and over all the royal household.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they were going on their way they came to a certain water,  and the eunuch said. "See, here is water! What hinders my being baptized?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>And Philip said, "If you believe with your whole heart, you may."  The eunuch answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he ordered the chariot to stop; and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>Meanwhile the men who were his fellow travelers stood speechless,  hearing indeed the voice, but beholding no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>And Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open, he continued to perceive nothing; so they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he remained there three days, seeing nothing, and without eating or drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now there was in Damascus a disciple named Ananias, and the Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, "Ananias!" And he answered, "Lo, I am here, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord said to him. "Arise, go into the street named Straight, and make inquiries in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus, one Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>He is now praying, and has seen a man named Ananias enter and lay his hands on him to restore his sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>"But, Lord," said Ananias, "I have heard from many about that man,  and how much evil he did to the saints at Jerusalem!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>"In this city, too, he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all those who call upon thy name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>"Go," answered the Lord, "this man is chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before the nations and their kings, and before the Children of Israel also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>"for I am going to show him all he has to suffer for the sake of my name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And so Ananias went and entered into the house, and laying his hands on him, said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on your journey, has sent me that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>Instantly something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>Afterward he took food and was strengthened. And he remained for some time with the disciples at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And he began at once to proclaim in the synagogues Jesus as the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>His hearers were all astonished, and began to say. "Is not this the very man who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called upon the Name? Did he not come hither for the express purpose of carrying them all in chains to the high priests?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul gained more and more influence, and kept putting the Jews who lived in Damascus to confusion by his proof that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And when many days were fulfilled the Jews made a plot to kill Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but information of their plot was given Saul, and although they kept watch day and night on the gates, in order to make away with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>his disciples took him by night, and let him down over the wall,  lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>So he came to Jerusalem, and attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and told them how Saul had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him;  and also how he had preached the Name of the Lord Jesus boldly at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city, and speaking fearlessly in the Name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>He also used to hold conversations and debates with the Grecian Jews, but they kept trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>When they learned this the brothers took him down to Caesarea, and then sent him forth to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Now throughout the whole of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria the Church continued to enjoy peace and to be spiritually built up. It was increasing in members also, as it kept walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Now Peter, as he was going from town to town, came down also to the saints who lived in Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>Here he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, a paralytic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him. "Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you! Rise and make your own bed!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>At once he rose to his feet. All the people of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Among the disciples at Joppa was a woman named Tabitha - which may be translated Dorcas or "Gazelle" - a woman whose life was full of good works and almsgiving, which she was doing continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>She, as it happened, was taken ill just at that time, and died.  After washing her body, they laid it in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And as Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, when they heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the entreaty, "Delay not to come to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>So Peter arose and went with them. On his arrival they took him up-  stairs, and all the widows stood near him, weeping, and showing him the cloaks and garments which Dorcas used to make, while she was still with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter put them all out, and kneeled down, and prayed; and then turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, rise!" She opened her eyes,  and on seeing Peter she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>Then he gave her his hand and raised her up, and after calling the saints and the widows, he gave her back to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>This incident became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>Peter stayed for some time in Joppa, lodging in the house of Simon,  the tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now there was at Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a captain in the Italian regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was a devout man and God-fearing, and so were all his household.  He gave many alms to the people, and constantly prayed to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About three oclock one afternoon he had a vision, and distinctly saw an angel of God enter his house and say to him, "Cornelius."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>He stared at him in terror, and said, "What is it, Lord?" "Your prayers and your alms have risen for a memorial before God," answered the angel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>"and now send men to Joppa and fetch one Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>"He is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner, whose house is near the sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And after the angel who was speaking to him was gone, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier who was in constant attendance upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and after telling them everything, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>The next day, while they were still on their way and were approaching the town, about noon, Peter went up to the housetop to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He had become very hungry and longed for food; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>He beheld the sky opened, and a vessel descending like an enormous sail let down to earth by four corners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In it were all kinds of quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth,  and wild birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>A voice came to him, saying, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>"Not so, my Lord," answered Peter, "for I have never yet eaten anything common and unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And again a second time came to him a voice, saying, "What God has cleansed you must not call common."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened three times; and immediately the sail was drawn up into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter was greatly perplexed to know what the vision which he had been sent by Cornelius, and had made inquiries for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and called and asked whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>So the Spirit said to Peter, who was still pondering over the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>"Three men are now looking for you. Rise, go down and go with them,  nothing doubting; for it is I who have sent them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>So Peter went down to the men and said. "I am the man you are looking for. What is the reason of your coming?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>"Cornelius," they answered, "a captain, a devout man, and God-  fearing, of whom the whole, Jewish nation speaks well, was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your message."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>So he invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he rose,  and went off with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>and the day after that they reached Caesarea. There Cornelius was waiting for them, and had brought together all his relatives and intimate friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>When Peter entered the house Cornelius met him, fell at his feet,  and worshiped him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>but Peter lifted him up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man,  myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he talked with him, he went in and found a large company assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>To them he said. "You know, yourselves, that it is illegal for a Jew to associate with or to visit one of another nation; but God has taught me that I should not call any man common or unclean. For this reason, when sent for, I came without demur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>"I ask therefore why you sent for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius answered. "Three days ago, at this very hour, I was praying in my house at three oclock in the afternoon, when suddenly a man in a shining robe stood by me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said. "Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>"So send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. He is lodging with Simon the tanner, in a house by the seaside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>"So I sent for you without delay, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to listen to what the Lord has commanded you to speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter began to speak. "Of a truth I begin to see quite plainly that God is no respecter of persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>"but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>"You cannot but know the message which he sent to the descendants of Israel, when he preached the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ who is Lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>"you know the message spread throughout all Judea, beginning in Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about everywhere doing good, and curing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>"And we were witnesses of all that he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>"But him God raised up on the third day, and permitted him to be made manifest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>"not to all the people, but to witnesses - men previously chosen by God - that is, to us, who ate and drank with him after he had risen from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>"when he charged us to preach to the people, and to testify that this was he whom God ordained to be the judge of the living and of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>"To him all the prophets bear witness, testifying that through his name every one that believes on him will receive remission of sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And all the Jewish believers who had accompanied Peter were amazed,  because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Then Peter said, "Can any one refuse water for the baptism of these men who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.  Then they begged him to remain with them for a time.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and the brothers that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>so, when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party disputed with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, "You went into the houses of the uncircumcised and ate with them!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Then Peter began and explained the whole matter to them in order,  saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>"I was in the city of Joppa, praying, and while in a trance I saw a vision; a certain vessel descending, what seemed to be an enormous sail let down to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>and while I gazed at it, I examined it carefully, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth and the wild beasts and creeping things and the wild birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>I also heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>"Not so, my Lord said I, for nothing common or unclean has ever gone into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>"But for the second time a voice spoke from the sky, What God has cleansed, you must not call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>"This was said three times, and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>"And lo! at that very moment, three men who had been sent for me from Caesarea stood before the house in which I was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>"And the Spirit bade me accompany them without misgiving. There also accompanied me these six brothers, and we went into the mans house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>"Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying. "Send to Joppa and fetch Simon who is also called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>"He will speak words to you by which you and all your family will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>"And," said Peter, "as soon as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as he fell upon us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>"Then I remembered the words of the Lord, how he used to say, "John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>"So if God gave them the same gift as he gave to us, when we first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>On hearing this they held their peace and glorified God, saying,  "Forsooth then, to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Then those who had been scattered by the trouble that arose over Stephen, traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch; but they preached the word to none except Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>Some of them, however, were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on reaching Antioch, began to tell the Greeks also the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>When news of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>When he arrived, and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord, with full purpose of heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>for he was a good man, and full of faith and the Holy Spirit. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas visited Tarsus, to try to find Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch, where for a whole year they were guests of the church, and taught many people.  And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of "Christians."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them, who was Agabus, rose up, and being instructed by the Spirit, predicted that a great famine was about to come upon the whole inhabited earth. (It came in the reign of Claudius.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>So the disciples decided to send relief, every man according to his means, to the brothers in Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>This they did, forwarding their contributions to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now, at about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands to ill-  treat certain members of the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>and beheaded James, the brother of John, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. (This was during the days of unleavened bread.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>He had him arrested and thrown in prison, and put under guard of sixteen soldiers. He intended, after the Passover, to bring him forth to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God was made by the church for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>Now when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that very night,  while Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. Striking Peter on the side, he woke him saying, "Rise up quickly." At once the chains dropped from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>"Gird yourself," said the angel, "and put on your sandals." He did so. Then he said unto him, "Throw your cloak about you, and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>So Peter went out, following him, but did not realize that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And when they had passed the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that led to the city. This opened to them of its own accord; and they went out passed on through one street; and suddenly the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>Peter, coming to himself, said, "Now I know for a certainty that the Lord has sent his angel and released me from the hand of Herod, and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>So, after he had thought things over, he went to the house of Mary,  the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where a large number of people were assembled, praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>When he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid servant named Rhoda came to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And when she recognized Peters voice, for very joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing in front of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>"You are mad," they said. But she confidently insisted that it was so. "It is his angel," they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>Meanwhile Peter continued to knock, until at last they opened the door, and were amazed to see that it was really he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>He motioned to them to keep quiet, and told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell all this to James," he said, "and to the brothers," and away he went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>When morning came there was no small stir among the soldiers as to what could possibly have become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>Then Herod had search made for him, and could not find him. After sharply questioning the guards, he ordered them off to execution. He then went down from Judea to Caesarea, where he stayed for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod was violently displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him, with one accord, and after conciliating Blastus, the royal chamberlain, they begged for peace because their country depended upon the kings country for its food supply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>So on the appointed day, Herod put on his royal robes, and after taking his seat upon the throne, began to harangue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>"The voice of a god, and not of a man," the people kept shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Instantly an angel of the Lord smote him, because he had not given God the glory, and being eaten up by worms, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God grew and multiplied;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>and after discharging their mission, Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, bringing with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were in the church in Antioch prophets and teachers;  Barnabas and Symeon, surnamed "the Black," Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen,  the foster-brother of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>And as they were worshiping the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said to them, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>So after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>So they, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And while they were in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>They had John Mark as an assistant; and after going through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain Jewish sorcerer and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who belonged to the suite of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. He summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas, "the sorcerer," for that is the translation of his name,  opposed them, and tried to divert the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>So Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, gazed steadily at him, and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>"O full of all craft and cunning, you son of the devil! You enemy of all goodness! Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>"The Lords hand is now upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season." Instantly there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and groping about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed. He was astounded at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>"For about forty years he bore with them in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>"and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>"And afterwards he gave them Judges, until Samuel, the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>"Then they asked for a king, and he gave them Saul, the son of Kish,  a Benjamite for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>After deposing him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also bore witness, when he said, "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, and who will obey all my will.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>As Paul and Barnabas left the synagogue, the people earnestly begged that these words might be repeated to them on the following Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>When the congregation broke up, many of the Jews, and of the devout proselytes, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them, and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>On the next Sabbath almost the entire city was gathered together to know the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>When they saw the crowds, the Jews were filled with jealousy, and began to contradict Pauls statements, and to abuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>So Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly. "It was necessary," they said, "first to proclaim the word of God to you. But since you push it away from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo,  we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>"For such is Gods command to us, saying, "I have set thee for a light to the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who had been ordained to eternal life, believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>So the Lords message went far and wide, through the whole district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews urged on the devout women of high rank, and the leading citizens, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of the district,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>As for the disciples, they were continually filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>In Iconium it happened that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great number both of Jews and of Gentiles believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the disobedient Jews stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and embittered them against them against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Long time, therefore, they tarried there, speaking fearlessly in the Lord, who attested the word of his grace by permitting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the mass of the citys people was divided; part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>And when both the Gentiles and the Jews with their ruler made a hostile move to maltreat and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>the apostles got wind of it, and made their escape to the Lycaonian towns of Derbe and Lystra and the neighboring country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And there they continued to proclaim the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>Now at Lystra there used to sit a certain man, lame in his feet, a cripple from birth, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>He was listening while Paul was preaching, and Paul, looking intently at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be made whole,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And he sprang up and began to walk about. Then the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, shouted in the Lycaonian tongue, saying, "The gods are come down to us in human form."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they began to call Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul, since he was the principal speaker, "Hermes";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>and the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and along with the crowds was about to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles, Paul and Barnabas, heard of it, they rent their garments and rushed out among the crowd, shouting and crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>"Men, why are you doing all this? We also are men, with natures like your own! We are bringing you good tidings, that you are to turn from these empty things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>In bygone generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>and yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good,  and gave you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>Even with saying this they with difficulty restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>And now a party of Jews came down form Antioch and Iconium, and after persuading the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But as the disciples collected around him, he rose and went back into the city. The next day he went off with Barnabas into Derbe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>and after preaching the gospel to that town, and winning many converts, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>Everywhere they strengthened the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to hold to the faith. "It is through many tribulations," they said, "that we must enter into the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>They chose elders for them in every church, after prayer and fasting, and commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>Then passing through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia and,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>after preaching the word in Perga, they came down to Attaleia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>Thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had now completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>On their arrival they assembled the church and reported all things that God had done through them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And they tarried no little time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>But some men came down from Judea and attempted to teach the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised according to Moses  custom, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Now when dispute and controversy sprang up between them and Paul and Barnabas, the brethren appointed Paul and Barnabas, and certain others, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>So the church saw them off on their journey, and they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria. Here they set forth the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were received by the church and the apostles and elders, and they told them all things that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But certain men who had belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, but were now believers, stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise Gentile, and to order them to keep the Law of Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>The apostles and elders met to consider the matter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>and after there had been a long discussion, Peter rose and said.  "Brothers, you know how a good while ago God made choice among you,  that from my lips the Gentiles were to hear the message of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>"And God, who knows the hearts of all, gave this testimony in their behalf, by bestowing upon them the Holy Spirit just as he did upon us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>"and he made no distinction between us and them, in cleansing their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>"Now then, why are you tempting God by laying on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>"On the contrary we believe that it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we and they shall be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>Then the whole assembly remained silent, and listened to Barnabas and Saul as they told the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>When they had finished speaking, James said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>"Brothers, listen to me. Symeon has told how God first looked graciously upon the Gentiles, to take out from among them a people to be called by his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>"And this is in harmony with the language of the prophets, which says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>"After these things I will return, And I will rebuild Davids fallen tent; And I will build again its ruins, And I will set it up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>"So that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, Even all the Gentiles, who are called by my name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>"Says the Lord, who has been making this known from the beginning of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>"My judgment therefore, is against troubling those who turn to God from among the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>"but that we should write to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from fornication, from meat killed by strangling, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>"For Moses from the earliest times has had his preachers in every town where he is read aloud, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the synagogues."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to select some of their number, and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. The men chosen were Judas called Bar-  Sabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>They took with them the following letter. "The apostles and older brothers send greeting to the Gentile Brotherhood throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>"as we have heard that some of your number who went out from us have troubled you with words and upset your souls, without having received any such instruction from us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>"we have unanimously decided to select certain men, and to send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>"men who have risked their very lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>"So we have sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>"For it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>"that you abstain from food that has been sacrificed to idols, and from tasting blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.  Keep yourselves clear from these things and it will be well with you.  Farewell."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>So they, when they had been despatched, went down to Antioch, and after gathering the whole multitude together, they handed them the letter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>and when they had read it they rejoiced at the comfort it brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many a good counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>After spending some time there the brothers let them go with a greeting of peace to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>Silas, however, stayed with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Paul and Barnabas also stayed in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, in company with others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let is go back and visit the brothers in every city in which we have proclaimed the word of the Lord. Let us see how they fare."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John, who was called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul thought it unwise to take with them one who had deserted them to the Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>So there arose a sharp irritation, so that they parted company;  Barnabas taking Mark with him, sailed away to Cyprus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>while Paul chose Silas, and set forth commended by the brothers to the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>And he came also to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a certain disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, and of a Greek father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>He was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconiun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Now Paul, wishing that this man should accompany him on his journey,  took him and circumcised him because of the local Jews, who all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they went on their way through the cities they handed them the resolutions which the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem had ordained for them to keep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the churches were strengthened in the faith and continued to increase in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Then they went through Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit having forbidden them to proclaim the message in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>When they got as far as Mysia, they attempted to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>and so they passed by Mysia and went on down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>Here a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia, entreating him and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>So when he had seen the vision, we sought at once to go forth into Macedonia, because we concluded that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>So we set sail from Troas and ran a straight course to Samothrace.  The next day we arrived in Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and thence came to Philippi, a city of Macedonia, the fore most in its district, a Roman colony. There we stayed for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath Day we went outside the city gate, to a riverside,  where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who had gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>Among them was a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, who belonged to the town of Thyatira. She, since she was a worshiper of God, listened to us, and the Lord opened her heart to attend to what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>When she was baptized, and her household, she urged us, saying, "If in your judgment I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she compelled us to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>Now as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl met us, who had a spirit of divination, and who brought her masters great gain by fortune-telling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She used to follow after Paul and us, crying out again and again,  "These men are servants of the most high God, who proclaimed to you the way of salvation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>She persisted in this for many days, until Paul, worn out, turned round and said to the spirit, "I charge you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her." In that very hour it came out of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them before the magistrates, into the market-place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>Then they brought them before the praetors, saying. "These fellows are Jews, who are making a great disturbance in our city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>"They are teaching customs which it is not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or practise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>The crowd, too, rose up together against them, and the praetors,  after having them stripped, and after ordering them to be flogged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>had many lashes inflicted upon them, and put them in prison, with a charge to the jailer to keep them safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>On receiving so strict an order he cast them into the inner prison,  and made their feet fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>But at midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the very foundations of the prison-house were shaken; and instantly all the doors were opened, and every ones chains fell off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>The jailer, roused from sleep, and seeing the doors wide open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he thought that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul shouted loudly to him. "Do yourself no harm; for we are all here!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>So he called for lights, and sprang in, and, trembling for fear,  fell down before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and brought them out, saying, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>"Believe on the Lord Jesus," they answered, "and you will be saved,  you and all your household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>Then they spoke the message of the Lord to him, as well as to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And he took them, the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, he and all his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And after bringing them up into his house, he set food before them,  overjoyed with all his household in having believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>But in the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order,  "Let these men go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>The jailer reported the words to Paul, saying. "The praetors have sent to release you; so come out, and go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said. "They have flogged us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Roman citizens; and have thrown us into prison. Are they now going to get rid of us secretly? No, indeed! Let them come here,  themselves and take us out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>The lictors reported these words to the praetors, who were frightened when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>So they came and conciliated them, and after taking them out of prison, begged them to leave the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>So Paul and Silas came out of the prison, and went to Lydias house;  and after they had seen the brethren and encouraged them, they left Philippi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a Jewish synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>and Paul, according to his usual custom, went in to them and, for three Sabbath Days, he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>explaining and quoting passages to prove that the Messiah had to suffer and to rise again from the dead and that "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming unto you is the Messiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas,  including a number of devout Greeks, and a large number of the leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews, moved with jealousy, called to their aid certain ill-  favored and idle fellows, formed a mob, and began to set the town in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>And when they had failed to find Paul and Silas, they began to drag Jason and some of the brethren before the politarchs, shouting.  "These fellows who have upset the habitable earth are come hither also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>"Jason has received them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>Both the crowd and the politarchs were disturbed when they heard this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>but when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>Now the brothers sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they got there they betook themselves to the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>The Jews of Berea were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they very readily received the message with all readiness of mind, and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>So many of them became believers, and so did not a few Greeks, women of honorable estate, and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>As soon as the Jews in Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also, they came there, and stirred up and troubled the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then the brothers at once sent Paul down to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>Those who were caring for Paul brought him as far as Athens, and there left him, with instructions to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he noticed that the city was full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>He argued in the synagogues with the Jews and the devout proselytes,  and also daily in the market-place with those that met him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>A few of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him again and again. Some were saying, "What has this beggarly fellow to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods,"  because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>Then they laid hold of him and brought him up to Mars Hill, saying.  "May we be told what this new teaching of yours is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>"For you are bringing certain strange things to our ears. We want to know, therefore, what these things mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but to tell or to hear some new thing.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>So Paul stood up in the center of Mars Hill, and said. "Men of Athens, I perceive that in all respects you are remarkably religious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>"For as I was passing along and observing your objects of worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What you are worshiping in ignorance, this I am proclaiming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>"The God who made the universe and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>"neither is he served by mens hands, as though he needed anything,  since he himself gives to all life and breath and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>"He has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons and the bounds of their habitation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>"so that they might seek God, if perhaps they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from every on of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>"for in him we live and move and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, "For we also are his offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>"Since then we are Gods offspring, we ought not to imagine that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but he now commands all men that they should all, everywhere, repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>inasmuch as he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world justly, by the Man whom he has ordained, and he has given proof of all this by raising him from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>But on hearing of the resurrection of the dead, some began to mock;  but others said, "We will hear you again on that subject."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul withdrew from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>A few, however, attached themselves to him and believed, among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and some others.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>Here he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife, Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>Paul came to them, and because he was of the same trade with them,  he lodged with them, and worked with them - for by trade they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>Every Sabbath he used to preach in the synagogue, and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was engrossed in his message, earnestly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But as they opposed him and abused him, he shook out his garments in protest, and said. "Your blood be upon your own hands. I am clean.  From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>So he left the place, and went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the warden of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his household; and many of the Corinthians from time to time listened, believed, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord said to Paul in a vision, by night. "Have no fear; go on speaking, and do not keep silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>"for I am with you, and no one shall set upon you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So he lived there a year and six months and continued to teach them the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose against Paul, and brought him before the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>"This fellow," they said, "is persuading men to offer unlawful worship to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>Paul was about to open his mouth, when Gallio said to the Jews. "If it had been some misdemeanor or wicked villainy, it would have been within reason for me to listen to you Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but as these are merely questions about words and names and your own law, you yourselves must see to it. I am not willing to be a judge of these matters."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then they all laid hold of Sosthenes, the warden of the synagogue,  and beat him in front of the tribunal; but Gallio took no notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul after remaining in Corinth some time longer, took leave of the brothers, and sailed away to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. As Paul was under a vow, he had his head shaved at Cenchrea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>When they came to Ephesus he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>When they begged him to stay longer, he would not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but said, as he took leave of them, "I will return again to you, if God will."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>Then, setting sail from Ephesus, he landed at Caesarea; he went up to Jerusalem and saluted the church, and came down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After spending some time there, he set out and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, and strengthened all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>He had been instructed in the ways of the Lord, and being full of zeal, he used to speak and to teach accurately the facts about Jesus,  although he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him home and explained to him more accurately the way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>When he wished to cross over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples in Corinth to receive him. On his arrival he mightily helped those who through grace had believed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>Now it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the hinterland, came to Ephesus, where he found a few disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" he asked them.  "No" said they, "we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>"Into what, then, were you baptized?" he asked. And they said, "Into the baptism of John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>"John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance," answered Paul, "telling the people to believe on One who was coming after him,  namely, on Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>When they heard this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>and after Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak with tongues, and to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>They were in all about twelve men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>Then Paul went into the synagogue, and there continued to preach fearlessly for about three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some grew hardened and disobedient, and spoke evil of the Way before the crowd, he left them, withdrew the disciples, and continued to hold discussions daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia heard the Lords message, Jews as well as Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God also wrought extraordinary miracles by the hand of Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so much so, that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick; and their diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>But there were also some strolling Jewish exorcists, who took it upon them to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish high priest who used to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I have heard of, but who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them,  overpowered them and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this became known to all the people of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Awe fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many also of those who became believers used to come to confess and to declare their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>And some of them who had practised magic arts, collected their books, and burned them in the presence of all. And they counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>So mightily the word of the Lord continued to grow and to prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>Now after these things were ended, Paul resolved in his spirit to travel through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem. "After I get there," he said, "I must see Rome, too."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>So he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, while he himself kept back for a time on his way into Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>Now just at this time, there arose no small commotion concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>There was a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, and brought rich profit to his workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>He gathered them together with others of like occupation, and said.  "Men, you know that by this business we make our money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>"And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all of Asia, this fellow Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, by telling them that they are no gods at all who are made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>"So there is danger not only that our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be brought into disrepute, and that she herself may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world now worships."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>After listening to this they were filled with rage, and cried out again and again, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>The city was filled with commotion. They rushed like one man into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians,  Pauls companions in travel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>When Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not let him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>and some of the Asiarchs, too, who were his friends, sent word to him repeatedly, entreating him not to venture into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Now some were shouting one thing, some another, for the assembly was in an uproar, and the majority had no idea why they were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they brought Alexander out of the crowd, whom the Jews had pushed forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, would have made a defense to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>but when they saw that he was a Jew they all, with one voice, for about two hours, shouted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>At length the recorder got them quiet. "Men of Ephesus," he said,  "who here does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-  guardian of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>"Since these facts cannot be gainsaid, you ought to be calm and do nothing reckless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>"For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If then Demetrius and his craftsmen have a grievance against any one, the courts are open and there are the proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you desire anything further, it must be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For indeed we are in danger of being accused in regard to this days riot, since there is no cause for it, nor shall we be able to give account for this disorderly gathering."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>With these words he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and, after embracing them, bade them farewell, and started for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And when he had passed through those districts and encouraged the disciples in many addresses, he came into Greece where he spent three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>Just as he was about to set sail for Syria, the Jews laid a plot against him, and he determined to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>There accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>Now these had gone on, and were awaiting us at Troas;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>but we ourselves set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and joined them five days later at Troas. There we remained for a week.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week we met for the breaking of bread, and Paul, who was going away the next morning, began preaching to them,  and prolonged his discourse until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>and a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window, overborne by deep sleep, while Paul continued to preach at length. Overcome at last by sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>Then Paul went down, threw himself upon him, and embracing him,  said. "Do not lament; his life is still in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>Then he went upstairs again, broke bread and took some food, and after talking with them a long time, even until daybreak, he left them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>They had taken the lad home alive, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>The rest of us going before to the ship, set sail for Assos,  intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had appointed,  because he intended to go by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>We sailed from thence, and arrived next day off Chios; and the day after we touched at Samos; and the following day we came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend time in Asia, for he was hurrying to get to Jerusalem, if it were possible, by the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church to come to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>and when they arrived, he said to them. "You yourselves know quite well, how I lived among you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>"serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and amid trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>"You know that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable, nor from teaching you publicity and in your homes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what will befall me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that in city after city the Holy Spirit is warning me that bonds and afflictions are awaiting me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I hold not my life of any account, as dear unto myself, if only I may run my race, and accomplish the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to attest the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now I know that not one of you among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will ever see my face again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>So I testify to you this day that I am clear from the blood of all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>I never shrank from telling you the whole counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, and be shepherds of the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you,  and they will not spare the flock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>and that from among your own number, men will arise, perverting the truth, to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>So be on guard; and remember that for three years I ceased not to admonish you all, night and day, even with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>"And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace. He is able to build you up, and to give you your inheritance among all those who are consecrated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>"No mans silver or gold of clothing did I ever covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>"You yourselves know how these hands of mine provided for my needs,  and those of my companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>"In all things I have set you an example, how that so toiling, you ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,  how he himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>When he had so said, Paul kneeled down, and prayed with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And they all began, with loud lamentations, to throw their arms about his neck, and to kiss him lovingly, again and again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>sorrowing most of all for the words that he had spoken, that after that day they should look upon his face no more. And they began to escort him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>When at least we had torn ourselves away, and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos, and next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>And when we had found a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left hand, we sailed for Syria, and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>We looked up the local disciples and remained there seven days; and these disciples kept telling Paul, through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>When, however, our time was up, we left and started on our journey;  and all of them, with wives and children, were escorting us on our way until we were out of the city; then, kneeling down on the beach,  we prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>and said good-bye, and went on board the ship, while they returned home again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we reached Ptolemais,  and greeted the brothers and stayed with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>On the morrow we started for Caesarea, where we went into the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Now Philip had four unmarried daughters who prophesied,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>and while we remained there many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>He came to us, and taking Pauls girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, saying, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, so will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the owner of this girdle, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>As soon as we heard these words, both we and those who were standing near entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>"What do you mean by thus breaking my heart with your grief?"  answered Paul. "For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The will of the Lord be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>A few days after this we took up our luggage and went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>And some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us. They led us to the house of Mnason, a Cypriote, a disciple of long standing, with whom we were to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>At length we reached Jerusalem, and the brothers there received us gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>On the following day we went with Paul to call on James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>After saluting them Paul rehearsed, one by one, the things that God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And they, when they heard it, glorified God, and said to him. "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>"Now what they have been told about you, again and again, is that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses,  and not to circumcise their children, nor to follow the old customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>"What then ought to be done? They will certainly hear that you are come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>"So do this that we tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>"We have four men here under a vow; associate yourself with them,  purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they may have their heads shaved; then every one will know that there is no truth in the rumors that they have heard about you; but that you yourself walk orderly obeying the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>"As for the Gentile believers, we wrote giving judgment that they should abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men, and after purifying himself with them next day, went into the temple to declare the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>But when the seven days were almost over, the Asiatic Jews caught sight of him in the temple, and began to stir up all the crowd, and laid hands on him, shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>"Men of Israel, help! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the people, and the Law, and this place. And he has actually brought Gentiles even into the temple, and has desecrated the holy place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>(For they had formerly seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>The whole city was thrown into uproar. The mob surged together,  seized Paul, and began to drag him outside the temple. Whereupon the doors were at once shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>While they were attempting to kill him, news came to the tribune commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>At once he took soldiers and centurions, and rushed down upon them.  When they saw the tribune and the troops, they left off beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the tribune came up and seized him, and ordered that he be bound with two chains. "Who is he?" he began asking, "and what has he done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some among the crowd kept shouting one thing, some another; and when the tribune could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered Paul into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When was going up the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers,  because of the violence of the mob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the whole mass of the people were following him, shouting, "Away with him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>Just as he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the tribune, "May I speak to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>"Do you know Greek?" said the tribune; "Are you not, then, the Egyptian who in days gone by stirred up to sedition, and let into the wilderness the four thousand cutthroats?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>"I am a Jew," answered Paul, "a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I pray you, give me permission to speak to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>So when he had given leave, Paul stood on the stairs, beckoning with his hands to the people. There came a great hush, and he spoke to them as follows, in Hebrew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make in your presence."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>When they heard him speaking in Hebrew they became the more quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>"I am a Jew," he said, "born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strict manner of the Law of our forefathers, ardent for God, even as you all are this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>"I persecuted to the death this way, continually binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>"To this the high priest and all the council of elders are witnesses. It was from them that I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was already on my way to bring those also who were there back to Jerusalem, in bonds, for punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>"But when, on my journey, I was nearing Damascus, about noon,  suddenly a great light from heaven shone round about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>"I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul! Saul!  why are you persecuting me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>"Who are you, Lord? I asked. "I am Jesus, the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting, he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>"Now my companions, though they beheld the light, did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said to me, Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>"And as I was seeing nothing for the glory of the light, I was led by the hand of my companions, and so came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>"And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the Law, well thought of by all the Jews who lived there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>"came to me, and standing by me, said to me, "Brother Saul, receive your sight "In that very hour I regained my sight and looked up at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>"Then he said. "The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know his will; and to see the righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>"For before the face of all men you will be a witness for him of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>"And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>"After my return to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>"I fell into a trance and saw him saying to me, "Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>"Lord, I replied, they themselves well know that I was beating and imprisoning in synagogue after synagogue those who believed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>"and when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting, and holding the garments of his murders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>"Depart, he said to me, for I will send you forth, far hence, to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>Until they heard this last statement, the people were listening to Paul, but now they roared out. "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He is not fit to live!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>When they continued to shout, throwing their clothes into the air,  and flinging dust around,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and examined under the lash, to learn for what reason the people were thus crying out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing near, "If a man is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned, is it lawful for you to scourge him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him. "What are you intending to do? This man is a Roman citizen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>So the tribune came to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>"I paid a large sum to get this citizenship," said the tribune. "But I was citizen-born," said Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then those who were about to scourge him, immediately left him. And the tribune too, was afraid, when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>The next day, as he wished to learn the real reason why the Jews accused Paul, he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and brought Paul down, and placed him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>With a stedfast gaze at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived with a good conscience before God to this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>Then the High Priest Ananias ordered those who stood near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>"You whited sepulcher," exclaimed Paul, "God will strike you! You are sitting there to judge me according to the law, are you? And do you command me to be struck, contrary to the Law?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>"Do you rail at Gods high priest?" said the bystanders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>"Brothers, I did not know that he was the high priest," exclaimed Paul, "for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of my people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Then perceiving that half the Sanhedrin were Sadducees and the other half Pharisee, he cried out in the Sanhedrin. "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees! It is for the hope of the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>When he said this, there arose a quarrel between the Pharisees and Sadducees; the meeting was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; the Pharisees affirm them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>Then a great clamor arose; some of the scribes who belonged to the Pharisaic party stood up, and contended. "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>But when the dissension became violent, the tribune, fearing that they would tear Paul in pieces, ordered the troops to march down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the following night the Lord stood by him and said. "Be of good courage; for as you have borne faithful witness concerning me at Jerusalem, so you must testify at Rome also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>When day dawned the Jews made a conspiracy, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And there were more than forty who had sworn this oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They went to the high priests and elders, and said to them. "We have bound ourselves by a solemn oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>"Now do you and the Sanhedrin ask the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you would judge his case more exactly; and we are ready to kill him, before he comes near the place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Pauls sisters son heard of their intended attack, and he went and got into the barracks, and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul called one of the centurions, and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him, and brought his to the tribune, and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me to him, and begged me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the tribune took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>"The Jews," he answered, "have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though they wish to examine his case in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>"Now do not let them persuade, for more than forty men are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse, not to eat nor drink until they have killed him; even now they are all ready,  awaiting your consent."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the tribune sent the young man home with the injunction, "Tell no man that you have given me this information."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>Then he called two centurions to him and said. "Get ready by nine oclock tonight two hundred infantry to march as far as Caesarea, and also seventy troopers and two hundred spearmen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>He further ordered them to provide horses on which to mount Paul, so as to bring him safely to Felix, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>He also wrote a letter in the following terms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>"Claudius Lysais unto the Most Excellent Governor Felix, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>"This man Paul had been seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the troops, and rescued him, as I had learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>"Anxious to find out why they had accused him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>"Here I learned that he was accused about questions of their law,  but was not charged with anything worthy of death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>"Now when I received information that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him at once to you, charging his accusers also to speak against him before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers took Paul, as they were bid, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>Next day the infantry returned to the barracks, leaving the troopers to ride on with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>They reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, and also presented Paul before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>After reading the letter, he asked to what province he belonged, and when he understood that he was of Cilicia, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>"I will hear your case when your accusers also are come." And he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herods palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>Five days later, Ananias the high priest came down to Caesarea with some of the elders, and with an orator, named Tertullus. They laid information before the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>So Paul was sent for, and then Tertullus began to accuse him,  saying. "As it is owing to your excellency that we enjoy profound peace, and that the state of this nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>"owing to your wise care, has been improved in every respect and in every place, we accept it with profound thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>"But not to weary you too much, I beg of your Excellency to listen to a few words from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>"For we have found this fellow a pest, an inciter of insurrection among all the Jews of the empire, and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>"He even tried to profane the Temple, but we arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>"Then the chief captain, Lysias came and violently took him from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>From him you will be able, by examining Paul yourself, to learn the truth of all these charges we are bringing against him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews also joined in the charge, maintaining that these were the facts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Then at a nod from the governor, Paul spoke. "Because I know that for many years you have been a judge in this nation, I feel encouraged to make my defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>"For you have it in your power to know that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to Jerusalem to worship;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>"and that neither in the Temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city, did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>"Nor can they prove the charges which they are now bringing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>"But this I confess to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors,  according to the Way which they call a heresy, believing everything that is according to the Law, or is written in the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>"and having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for,  that there is to be a resurrection both of the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>"Hence I too endeavor to have a conscience void of offense toward God and men alway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>"While I was thus engaged, they found me in the temple, purified,  with no crowd and no uproar. But there were certain Asiatic Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>"who ought to have been here before you, and to have made accusations if they had anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>"Or let these men themselves say what fault they found, when I appeared before the Sanhedrin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>"Unless it was for this one sentence which I uttered when I stood and cried, It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial today before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>At this point Felix, who had a pretty accurate knowledge of the Way,  adjourned the case, saying to the Jews, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will go carefully into the matter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he gave orders to the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, but treated with indulgence, and that his personal friends were not to be forbidden to minister to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Some days later Felix came, with his wife Drusilla, a Jewess; he sent for Paul, and listened to him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned about morality, self-control, and the future judgment, Felix was terrified, and said, "For the present go on your way, and when I find a convenient season, I will send for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He was hoping that Paul would give him money, and for this reason he used to send for him often to converse with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after two full years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and because he wished to curry favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul still in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Three days after Festus entered his province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>The high priest and the Jewish leaders laid charges against Paul before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>They urged him, asking it as a favor, to send for him to Jerusalem.  They meant to lay in wait for him and kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered that Paul was in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>"Let those then," he said, "who are in authority among you, go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>After staying not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day, after taking his seat upon the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When he came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought a number of serious charges against him, which they could not prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Paul said in his defense, "I have committed no crime against the Law of the Jews, against the Temple, or against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Will you go up to Jerusalem and be tried there by me upon these charges?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>"I am standing before Caesars tribunal," answered Paul, "where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>"If I am a criminal and have done anything for which I ought to die,  I do not object to die. But if none of their charges is true, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered. "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>A short time after this King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And while they tarried many days, Festus laid Pauls case before the king. "There is a man here," he said, "whom Felix left a prisoner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>"The chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him,  when I was at Jerusalem, demanding a sentence against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give any man up for punishment, before the accused had his accusers face to face,  and had opportunity of defending himself against the charges that had been brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>"So when a number of them came together here, I made no delay, but the next day took my seat in the tribunal, and commanded the man to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>"But when his accusers stood up, they did not begin charging him with any of the crimes that I was expecting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but they kept quarreling with him about certain matters connected with their own religion, and about one Jesus who had died, but whom Paul affirmed over and over was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>I was perplexed how to investigate such questions, and asked Paul whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul appealed to have his case reviewed for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be detained until I could send him up to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>"I should like to hear the man, myself," said Agrippa to Festus.  Festus answered, "You shall hear him tomorrow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and took their places in the hall of audience, accompanied by the tribunes and men of high rank in the city. At the command of Festus Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>"King Agrippa," said Festus, "and all men who are present with us,  you see here the man about whom the entire body of the Jews at Jerusalem, and here also, sent to me, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>"I could not find that he had done anything for which he ought to die; but as he himself has appealed to the Emperor, I have determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>"Now I have nothing very definite to tell our sovereign about him.  So I have brought the man before you all, and especially before you,  King Agrippa, in order that, after examination, I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>"For it does seem to me unreasonable to send a person without signifying the charges against him."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." So Paul stretched forth his hand and began to make his defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day, in regard to all the accusations brought against me by the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>"especially since you are an export in all Jewish customs and questions. I pray you, expert in all Jewish customs and questions. I pray you, hear me with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>"The kind of life I have lived from my youth upward among my own nation and at Jerusalem, all that early life of mine, is well known to all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>"They know me of old, if they are willing to testify, how that according to the strict sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>"Today I am standing trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>"a promise which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. It is concerning this hope, King Agrippa, that I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>"Why is it deemed incredible by you all, if God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>"I indeed once thought with myself that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>"And this also I did in Jerusalem. Armed with authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to death I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>"In all the synagogues also I punished them oftentimes, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my mad fury I was pursuing them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>"On this errand I was traveling to Damascus one day, armed with authority and commission of the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>"when at noon, as I journeyed, O King, I saw a light from heaven,  brighter than the sun, shining around me and around those who journeyed with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>"We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew. "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>"Who are you, Lord? I said. "And the Lord said. I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>"But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you my minister and my witness both of what you have already seen and of those things in which I will appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>"I will deliver you from the Jewish people, and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you to open their eyes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>"so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, in order to receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>"So then, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>"but I proceeded to preach, first to those in Damascus, and then in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God and do deeds worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>"For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>"But having obtained the help that comes from God, I stand even to this day witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said should come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>"how that the Christ must suffer, and how he should be the first to rise from the dead, and should bring a message of light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>As Paul thus made his defense, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice.  "Paul, you are raving mad; your great learning is driving you mad."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>"I am not mad, most noble Festus," said Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>"I am speaking words of sober truth. For the King, to whom I am speaking freely, knows of these matters. I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his notice; for these things were not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Agrippa answered, "In short, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>"Long or short," answered Paul, "my prayer to God is that not only you but all who are my hearers this day might become such as I am,  save for these chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>Then the king rose, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>When they had withdrawn they continued talking to one another. "This man is doing nothing," they said, "for which he deserves death or imprisonment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, "If he had not appealed to Caesar, he might have been set free."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they proceeded to hand over Paul and a few other prisoners to the custody of Julius, a centurion of the Imperial Regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>We embarked in a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports of the province of Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, accompanied us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day we touched at Sidon. There Julius treated Paul kindly,  and gave him leave to visit his friends and refresh himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>Putting to sea from thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus,  because the winds were against us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>and after sailing across the Cilician and Pamphylian waters, we came to Myra, in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy,  and put us on board of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>For many days we sailed slowly, and then arrived with difficulty over against Cnidus; from this point, as the wind did not further favor us, we ran under the lee of Crete, off Cape Salmone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and coasting along with difficulty we reached a place called Fair Havens, not far from the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>By this time the season was far advanced, and sailing had become dangerous (for the Autumn Fast was past); so Paul began to warn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>"Sirs," he said to them, "I perceive that the voyage will be attended with injury and serious loss, not only to the cargo and to the ship, but also to our own lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion paid greater heed to the master and to the owner than to anything that was spoken by Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>and as the harbor was ill adapted for winter quarters, the majority advised putting out to sea from thence, to see whether they could get to Phoenix and winter there, a harbor on the coast of Crete facing northeast and southeast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete,  close in shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But it was not long before a furious wind, called Euroclydon, rushed down from the island;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>Then we ran under the lee of a little island named Claudia, where with great difficulty we were able to secure the ships boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>After hauling it aboard, they used ropes to undergird the ship, and since they were fearful lest they should be driven upon the Syrtes,  they lowered the gear and lay to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And as we were being terribly battered by the storm, the next day they began to throw the freight overboard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ships tackling overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>Then when for many days neither sun nor stars were seen, and a great tempest still beat upon us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>When for a long time they had been without food, Paul stood among them and said. "Men, you ought to have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and so have spared yourselves this injury and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>"But now take courage. There will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>"for last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve,  stood by me and said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>"Fear not, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you the lives of all who are sailing with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>"So take courage, men! I believe God, I believe that things will turn out exactly as it has been told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>"But we must be cast upon a certain island."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>It was now the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when, about midnight, the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near to some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; and after a little they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Then, fearing lest we should run ashore on the rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and longed for day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>And when the sailors were trying to flee from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea under pretext of laying anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men remain on the ship, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ships boat and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And while day was dawning, Paul kept urging them all to take some food. "This is the fourteenth day," he said, "that you have been on the watch, fasting, having eaten nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>"So I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety. For there shall not a hair perish from the head of any one of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>When he had so said and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before them all, and broke it and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then they all cheered up and themselves took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>There were in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls, all told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>After eating a hearty meal, they began to lighten the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When it was day they tried in vain to recognize the land, but they spied an inlet with a sandy beach, and they began conferring to see whether they could drive the ship into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>They cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, and unloosing at the same time the ropes that tied the rudders, they hoisted the foresail to the breeze, and headed for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground;  the bow struck and remained fixed, but the stern began to break up under the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>Now the soldiers were planning to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim off and so escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion kept them from their purpose, because he wished to save Paul. He gave orders that those who could swim should first jump overboard and get to land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and that the rest should follow, some on planks and some on other bits of wreckage. And so it came to pass that all escaped safe to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And when we were escaped, we ascertained that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The foreign-speaking people showed us uncommon kindness, for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Now when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and thrown them on the fire, a viper crawled out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>When the natives saw the reptile hanging on his hand, they began saying to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet justice does not allow him to live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>However, he shook off the reptile into the fire and received no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But they kept expecting him to swell up or fall down dead suddenly.  But after waiting a long time, and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said over and over that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now in the neighborhood there were estates belonging to the governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He received us and entertained us for three days courteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>It happened however that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After this all the other sick people on the island came, and continued to be restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>These loaded us with many honors and, when at last we set sail, they put on board such things as we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>Three months passed before we set sail an Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island. Its name was "The Twin Brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>From thence, tacking round, we reached Rhegium. Next day a south wind sprang up, which brought us in a day to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>There we found brothers who invited us to stay a week with them.  Then we reached Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>From there the brothers, when they heard about us, came out to meet us as far as the Appian Forum and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we finally entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier to guard him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>Now three days later he called the leading Jews together, and when they were come together he said to them. "Brothers, I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>"Then when they had examined me they wanted to set me at liberty because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>"But when the Jews objected I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>This is the reason why I begged you to see and speak with me. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him. "We neither received any letters about you from Judea nor has any brother come hither to report or speak any harm of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>"But we are eager to hear from you what it is that you believe; for we all know that as for this sect it is everywhere spoken against."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>So they arranged a day with him and came to him in his lodgings in great numbers. He expounded the matter to them; testifying to the Kingdom of God, and persuading them about Jesus, from morning till evening, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some began to believe what he said, but some were unbelieving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>Unable to agree among themselves, they began to go, but not before Paul had spoken a word to them, saying. "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your ancestors, through the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>"Go to the people and tell them, You will hear and hear, and by no means understand; And will look, and by no means see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For this peoples heart is grown obtuse, Their ears are heavy of hearing, Their eyes have they closed, Lest they should see with their eyes And hear with their ears, Lest they understand with their heart,  And turn again, and heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>"Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation of God is now sent unto the Gentiles. They will listen to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>When he finished speaking, the Jews departed, and reasoned among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>After this Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house,  and used to receive all who came to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>He continued to preach the kingdom of God, and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, quite unmolested.</verse>
