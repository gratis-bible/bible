        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent and revealed by his angel to his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified to the message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of what he had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is the one who reads, and blessed are they who listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here written; for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, ‘the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth.’ To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and he made us ‘a kingdom of priests in the service of God,’ his Father! — to Him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>‘He is coming among the clouds!’ Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; ‘and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him.’ So will it be. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>says the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I fell into a trance on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>It said —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the lamps one ‘like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet,’ and with a golden girdle across his breast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>‘The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet were like brass’ as when molten in a furnace; ‘his voice was like the sound of many streams,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like ‘the sun in the fulness of its power.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said —</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said — ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and ‘around the throne there was a rainbow’ of the color of an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four councillors sitting clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>Out from the throne ‘come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder’! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, ‘resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four Creatures full of eyes’ in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first Creature is like a lion, the second Creature like a calf, the third Creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth Creature is like an eagle on the wing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>These four Creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say —  ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who will be.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And, whenever these Creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is ‘seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four councillors prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>‘Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and honor, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding they came into being and were created.’</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>Then I saw at the right hand of him who was ‘seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed’ with seven seals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>and I saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice — ‘Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>But one of the councillors said to me — ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered — the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David — and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>Then, within the space between the throne and the four Creatures, and in the midst of the councillors, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And, when he had taken the book, the four Creatures and the twenty-four councillors prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they are singing a new song —  ‘You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the Creatures, and of the councillors. In number they were ‘ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>and they cried in a loud voice —  ‘Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and praise, and blessing.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying —  ‘To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honor, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four Creatures said ‘Amen,’ and the councillors prostrated themselves and worshiped.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four Creatures crying with a voice like thunder — ‘Come.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And in my vision I saw ‘a white horse.’ Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second Creature crying — ‘Come.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>Then there went out another horse, ‘a red horse,’ and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third Creature crying — ‘Come.’ And in my vision I saw ‘a black horse.’ Its rider held scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four Creatures, crying — ‘A quart of wheat for a silver coin, and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Creature crying — ‘Come.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider’s name was Death, and the Lord of the place of Death rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might ‘destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild beasts of the earth.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God’s message and for the testimony which they had borne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They cried in a loud voice — ‘How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends in Christ's service who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>‘The stars of the heavens fell’ to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person, ‘hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks’ of the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks — ‘Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this, I saw four angels standing ‘on the four corners of the earth,’ restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And, in the east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had been given power to harm the earth and the sea —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>‘Do not harm the earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>I heard, too, the number of those who had been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were from every tribe of the Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,from the tribe of Napthali twelve thousand,from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand,from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>And they are crying in a loud voice —  ‘salvation be ascribed to our God who is seated on his throne and to the Lamb.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>And all the angels were standing around the throne and the councillors and the four Creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>saying —  ‘Amen. Blessing and praise, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might be ascribed to our God for ever and ever. Amen.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the councillors turned to me and said ‘Who are these who are robed in white? And where did they come from?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>‘My Lord,’ I answered, ‘it is you who know.’ [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] ‘These,’ he said, ‘are they who come through the Great Persecution; they washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>And therefore it is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty, nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>for the Lamb that stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ’s people on the golden altar before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ’s people, from the hand of the angel before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed ‘peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning,’ and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>and a third part of all created things that are in the sea — that is, of all living things — died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice — ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of the smoke from the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth, and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only those who have not ‘the seal of God on their foreheads.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>Yet they were not allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a scorpion when it stings a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>In those days people ‘will seek Death and will not find it’; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their faces resembled human faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>and they had hair like the hair of a woman, their teeth were like lions’ teeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>and they had what seemed to be iron breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm people for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is ‘Abaddon,’ while, in Greek, his name is ‘Apollyon’ (the Destroyer).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the corners of the golden altar that stood before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>It spoke to the sixth angel — the angel with the trumpet — and said ‘Let loose the four angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>Then the four angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>The number of the hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>And this is what the horses and their riders appeared to be like in my vision: — They had breastplates of fire, blood-red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>Through these three curses a third of humanity perished — because of the fire, and the smoke, and the sulphur that issued from their mouths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>for the power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had made; they would not abandon the worship of ‘demons, and of idols made of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk’;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>and they did not repent of their murders, or their sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>in his hand he held a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>and he cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>And, when they spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say — ‘Keep secret what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down.’</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>With a mighty voice he cried — ‘She has fallen! She has fallen — Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>For, after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the excess of her luxury.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying — ‘Come out of her, my people, so that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses inflicted on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has not forgotten her misdeeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Pay her back the treatment with which she has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>for her self-glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture and misery. In her heart she says ‘I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I will never know misery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>Therefore in one day will these curses strike her — death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>All the kings of the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning city,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>their cargoes of gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood, or brass, or iron, or marble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense, or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat, or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the bodies and souls of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>The fruit that your soul craved is no longer within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never to be found again.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her torture, and crying —</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>In a single hour your vast wealth vanished.’ Every ship’s captain and all who sail to any port, and sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried — ‘What city can compare with the Great city?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>They threw dust on their heads, and, as they wept and wailed, they cried — ‘Alas! Alas! Great city! All who have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single hour it has vanished.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ, and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, crying — ‘So will Babylon, the great city, be violently overthrown, never more to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>No more will the music of harpers, or minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound of a mill be heard in you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>no more will the light of a lamp shine in you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were deceived by your magical charms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>Yes, and in her was to be found the blood of the prophets and of Christ’s people, and of all who have been put to death on the earth.’</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast throng in heaven, crying —  ‘Hallelujah! To our God belong salvation, and glory, and Power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the Great Harlot who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness, and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>Again they cried — ‘Hallelujah!’ And the smoke from her ruins rises for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>Then the twenty-four councillors and the Four Creatures prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, crying — ‘Amen, Hallelujah!’;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>and from the throne there came a voice which said —  ‘Praise our God all you who serve him, You who worship him, both high and low.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>Then I heard ‘what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the sound of many waters,’ and like the sound of loud peals of thunder, crying —  ‘Hallelujah! For the Lord is king, our God, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>Let us rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honor, for the hour for the Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>Then a voice said to me ‘Write — “Blessed are those who have been summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.”’ And the voice said — ‘These words of God are true.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>I prostrated myself at the feet of him who spoke to worship him, but he said to me — ‘Forbear; I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus needs the inspiration of the prophets.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>Then I saw that heaven lay open. There appears a white horse; its rider is called ‘Faithful’ and ‘True’; righteously does he judge and make war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes are flaming fires; on his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no one knows but himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood; and the name by which he is called is ‘The Word of God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>The armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with which ‘to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod.’ He ‘treads the grapes in the press’ of the maddening wine of the wrath of Almighty God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written — ‘KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven — ‘Gather and come to the great feast of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>The Beast was captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image. Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire - of burning sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their flesh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.20'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.1'>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let loose for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image, and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands. They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>(The rest of the dead were not restored to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>Blessed and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection.

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and surrounded the camp of Christ’s people and the city that he loves. Then fire fell from the heavens and consumed them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>and the devil, their deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the Beast and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and night for ever and ever.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. ‘The earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for them.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in the books.</verse>
